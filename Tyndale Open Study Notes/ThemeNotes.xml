<p class="theme-title">The Creation</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The creation account is foundational to the message of the entire Bible. Understanding the early chapters of Genesis is thus crucial to forming a biblical worldview.</p>
<p class="theme-body">These opening chapters deal with fundamental questions: Who created the world, and for what purpose? Why is the world in its present condition? Genesis answers these questions, dispelling the idolatry that Israel had acquired from their pagan masters in Egypt. In the Promised Land, the Israelites would again be surrounded by people who believed in false gods and worshiped created things rather than the Creator. Genesis taught Israel that the one true God created and has absolute authority over all things; he alone is worthy of worship.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God transformed chaos into the present ordered cosmos. In the first three days, he transformed the formless void into the structured universe—the heavens, the water and sky, and the earth. In the second three days, he populated each realm. The seventh day, God’s day of rest, provides the weekly pattern for human activity and points forward to the rest that God promised to those who live by faith in him (see <a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-4.11">Heb 3:7–4:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The creation account teaches that as God made the world, it was “very good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">Gen 1:31</a>). In this environment, humans enjoyed unbroken fellowship with their Creator until their rebellion severed that fellowship and implanted evil in human hearts (see <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-6.22">Gen 3–6</a>). The world’s evil does not come from some defect in creation; rather, it stems from rebellion to God’s design and purposes.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Since that first rebellion, humans have been alienated from the Creator and are prone to not recognize his presence and authority. This alienation results in shame, fractured relationships with God and other humans, estrangement from the rest of creation, and death (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.7-19">3:7-19</a>). Since that time, God has been working purposefully in history to restore humans to fellowship with him, which he is doing through Jesus Christ. Restored humans are a new creation (see <a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">Gal 6:15</a>); through Jesus, eternal life is open to all and God will one day renew all things (see <a href="?bref=Isa.65.17-25">Isa 65:17-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-22">Rom 8:19-22</a>). The whole cosmos will be made new (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rev 21:1</a>).</p>

<title>Human Sexuality</title>
<refs>Gen.1.27-28</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Human Sexuality</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When God created the first human beings in his own image, he created them as sexual beings, male and female (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.27">Gen 1:27</a>). Through their sexuality, they were to fill and govern the world (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">1:28</a>) and provide intimate companionship for one another in marriage (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.18-25">2:18-25</a>). Male and female sexuality is central to what it means to be human and is included in God’s declaration of creation as “very good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">1:31</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Sexual intimacy united the first man and woman as one, an effect that sexual intimacy continues to have. Since biblical sexuality is not just physical but has the total person in view, it validates sexual relations only as part of the partners’ permanent mutual commitment to each other’s ultimate good. The Bible speaks of engaging in sexual intercourse as literally “knowing” another person intimately (see <a href="?item=Gen.4.1_StudyNote_Filament">study note on Gen 4:1</a>). Since Creation, God’s intended context for sexual activity has been the intimate union of marriage—namely, a permanent and loving heterosexual commitment (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.27-28">Gen 1:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.2.23-24">2:23-24</a>). The sexual relationship cements the marriage bond in an intimacy that may result in reproduction and can continue even when reproduction is no longer possible.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although sexuality was created before sin, it did not emerge unscathed from human rebellion. Sexuality is a powerful force that is easily corrupted if not carefully channeled (see <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lev 18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.3-8">1 Thes 4:3-8</a>). Sexual intimacy apart from marital commitment perverts the order that God intended for creation. Incest, for example, violates sexual boundaries (see <a href="?bref=Lev.18.7-18">Lev 18:7-18</a>), collapses family structures (see <a href="?bref=Gen.19.30-38">Gen 19:30-38</a>), and fragments the community. Whereas perverted sexuality causes much harm, tears the community down (see <a href="?bref=Gen.38.1-30">Gen 38:1-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.39.7-9">39:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-20.48">Judg 19–20</a>), and exalts the individual (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.13.11-14">2 Sam 13:11-14</a>), biblical sexuality builds up the sexual partners and the community.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Human sexuality has been damaged through our fall into sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gen 3</a>), but God has redeemed it through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-20">1 Cor 6:12-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.31-33">Eph 5:31-33</a>). He restores sexual wholeness in those who trust his work in their lives by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15-20">15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.1-8">1 Thes 4:1-8</a>). Those who commit their sexuality to Christ’s work in their lives can serve as a testament to others of God’s love for his people (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.25-33">Eph 5:25-33</a>).</p>

<title>Biblical Marriage</title>
<refs>Gen.2.18-25</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Biblical Marriage</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">At the first wedding, God the Father gave the bride away to the groom and witnessed the couple’s interaction in his sanctuary-garden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.18-25">Gen 2:18-25</a>). Biblical marriage is a binding covenant commitment before God. Breaching that covenant (e.g., through adultery) is a sin against people and against God, who is a divine witness to and guarantor of the marriage covenant (see <a href="?bref=Mal.2.10-16">Mal 2:10-16</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.39.6-9">Gen 39:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.3.1">Jer 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-10">1 Cor 6:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.4">Heb 13:4</a>). Although marriage is exclusive, it is not private. It is legally declared in public, with community recognition, witnesses, and accountability (see <a href="?bref=Lev.20.10-12">Lev 20:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.22">Deut 22:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.20-23">Jer 29:20-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Marriage is also a metaphor of the Lord’s relationship with his people, first with Israel (see <a href="?bref=Exod.19.3-6">Exod 19:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-6">20:2-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.14">34:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.5">Isa 54:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">Ezek 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.19-20">Hos 2:19-20</a>), and then with the church (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.2">2 Cor 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.21-33">Eph 5:21-33</a>). A marriage points to something greater than itself—God’s people (Christ’s “bride”) await the return of Christ (the “groom”). Married Christians are called to live in unity and dignity as they anticipate the wedding feast of the Lamb (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.6-9">Rev 19:6-9</a>). Christ will live forever with his faithful people in glory (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.7">Rev 19:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">21:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.21.9">9</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Fall</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Genesis 3</a> describes how human moral innocence collapsed through rebellion. What God declared as “very good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">Gen 1:31</a>) was no longer completely so. Man and woman ate the fruit that promised knowledge of good and evil, thus breaking God’s command (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">2:16-17</a>) and attempting to become like God (see <a href="?bref=Gen.3.5">3:5</a>). In doing so, they fell from their sinless state. Alienated from God, one another, and creation, they also became subject to death.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Consequently, all humans are “fallen”—born in sin, predisposed to sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.21">Gen 8:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.4.17-21">Job 4:17-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.5">Pss 51:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.10">103:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.143.2">143:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.9">Prov 20:9</a>), and awaiting death. When the first man and woman ate the fruit in disobedience to God, they forfeited their own innocence and that of their children, the entire human race (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-14">Rom 5:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.21-22">1 Cor 15:21-22</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45-49">45-49</a>). The expression “original sin” denotes sin’s complete, universal infiltration into individual lives and human society as a result of human rebellion. As people yield to their inherited predisposition to sin, they become responsible for their own wrongdoing (<a href="?bref=Eccl.7.20">Eccl 7:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">Rom 3:23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The first man, Adam, introduced sin, but the “second Adam,” Jesus Christ, is sin’s antidote (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>). When Christ died as Redeemer, he made God’s salvation from sin available to all (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">John 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Retribution</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God gave humans the commission of procreating and caring for the world (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Gen 1:28</a>). But as humanity multiplied, spiritual wickedness, violence, and murder also multiplied (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.8">4:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.4.23">23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.6.5">6:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.6.11-13">11-13</a>), resulting in a corrupt world that required cleansing.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The purpose of the Flood was to enact God’s global cleansing and retribution against evildoers. <span class="ital">Retribution</span> means “giving what is due” and usually refers to recompense for wrongdoing. Retribution is motivated by the conviction that moral order is woven into the fabric of the world and must be maintained or restored (see <a href="?bref=Ps.7.14-16">Ps 7:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.17-21">Prov 11:17-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.26.27">26:27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God maintains moral order by meting out justice, punishing wickedness, and rewarding right behavior (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.7-8">Gal 6:7-8</a>). Since God oversees the world, it is never entirely overwhelmed by moral chaos; God holds people accountable for what they do. The judgment and exile of Adam and Eve (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8-24">Gen 3:8-24</a>), Cain’s sentence (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.10-15">4:10-15</a>), and the worldwide flood and annihilation (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-7.24">6–7</a>) are examples of God’s retribution. These events reveal a sovereign God who exacts just punishment in the context of his good intentions for the world (see also <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">Num 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.15-20">Deut 30:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Josh 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.2.1-3">Mic 2:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Retribution is an application of God’s righteousness; it purifies the world for his kingdom of peace. Through retribution, the divine King proclaims his universal rule and exercises his justice on all who reject his rule or defy his commands (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.10">Deut 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.1-9">Ps 149</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.25">Prov 15:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.15">Mic 5:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.22">1 Cor 16:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.8-9">Gal 1:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.5-10">2 Thes 1:5-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">For God’s people, retribution serves as his discipline. It is intended to restore covenant fellowship with him (see <a href="?bref=Isa.44.22">Isa 44:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.3.12-14">Jer 3:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.3.19-33">Lam 3:19-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.1-2">Hos 14:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.12-13">Joel 2:12-13</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-11">Heb 12:5-11</a>). When God’s people experience his chastening, they can respond in hope because God’s truth and righteousness will triumph (<a href="?bref=Ps.58.10-11">Ps 58:10-11</a>), and God will redeem and restore his people who trust in him (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.40-45">Lev 26:40-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.2-23">Hos 2:2-23</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">God’s Covenant with Noah</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The first explicit reference to a covenant in Scripture occurs immediately after the Flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.1-17">Gen 9:1-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The corruption and violence of the human race had provoked God’s anger (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.11-13">6:11-13</a>), but his gracious favor remained with Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.8">6:8</a>). When God charged Noah to build an ark to escape the impending deluge (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.13-17">6:13-17</a>), he also promised to establish a covenant with him (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.18">6:18</a>). God took the initiative to bind himself again to human beings and to the whole creation despite human faithlessness (see <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-7">6:1-7</a>). Through this covenant, God guaranteed that he would maintain a relationship with this one family even as other divine-human relationships were being severed. God’s covenant promise to Noah came with his command to build an ark (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.14">6:14</a>); Noah’s receipt of the covenant blessing depended on his obedience to this divine command (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.22">6:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.7.5">7:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Noah made an offering to God after the Flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20-22">8:20-22</a>), God elaborated on his covenant with Noah, indicating that it was a universal covenant with humans and with all living creatures (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.8-10">9:8-10</a>). God promised never to send such a flood again as judgment on the world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This covenant helps us understand God as a covenant maker. Although human beings deserve punishment because of their wickedness, God withholds ultimate destruction. God’s covenant with Noah did not establish an intimate relationship between God and each living being, but it recalibrated moral and ecological life to be as God intended it (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.1-7">9:1-7</a>), leaving open the possibility of a more intimate covenant to come (see <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-21">17:1-21</a>). Despite their evil, human beings are allowed to live in God’s world and seek a deeper relationship with the world’s Creator during their time on earth. God’s later covenants with his people made intimacy with him freely available to all (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.22-40">Acts 2:22-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.17-26">3:17-26</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Babel: The Dispersion of Nations</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The story of the tower of Babel, whose peak was to reach to heaven, explains how nations and ethnic groups were separated by language barriers and scattered geographically. After the Flood, when God had judged an exceedingly wicked human race, humans again rebelled against their Creator by constructing a tower “that reaches into the sky” (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.4">Gen 11:4</a>). Instead of worshiping the Lord, their intention was to exalt themselves and unify themselves apart from the Lord. God saw the danger that this posed: Their independence and arrogance would set them right back into a whirlpool of wickedness and, ultimately, destruction. So God intervened to “confuse the people with different languages” (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.7">11:7</a>) and “[scatter] them all over the world” (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.9">11:9</a>). Babel thus begins the history of differences and misunderstandings between peoples and nations who cannot understand one another’s languages and cultures—a separation that only begins to be reversed with the coming of the Holy Spirit (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">After the dispersion of the nations at Babel, God renewed his relationship with humanity in Abraham and his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-9">Gen 12:1-9</a>). In contrast with the people at Babel, Abraham was righteous because he “believed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” and lived by faith in God rather than pride in his accomplishments (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.19">18:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.5">26:5</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">God’s Covenants</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="ital">Covenant</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">berith</span>) means “bond”: A covenant is a binding relationship rooted in a commitment that includes promises and obligations. Whether between individuals (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.21.27">Gen 21:27</a>), whole nations (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.9.15-18">Josh 9:15-18</a>), or God and humans, the covenant relationship calls for faithfulness and makes peace and harmony possible.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The covenant theme in the Old Testament begins with Noah, through whom God made a covenant with all of creation. God promised to uphold the created order and gave the rainbow as the sign of this commitment (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.1-17">Gen 9:1-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God later established a covenant relationship with Abraham and his family; the sign of this covenant was circumcision (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-9">12:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">15:1-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">17:9-14</a>). God’s covenant with Abraham promised descendants, land, rulers, and the blessing of all nations; these promises formed the basis for the covenants God later made with his people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai was a national covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-24.18">Exod 19–24</a>) whose sign was the Sabbath; it addressed how Israel would be the chosen people of God. This covenant took the form of a suzerain-vassal treaty, an ancient relationship established between a great king and loyal subjects (see <a href="?item=Exod.20.1-23.33_StudyNote_Filament">study note on Exod 20:1–23:33</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Sinai covenant was renewed in Deuteronomy and in <a href="?bref=Josh.24.1-28">Joshua 24:1-28</a>. The renewal focused on God’s promise of land and how Israel would conduct itself while inhabiting the land. Through his covenant with Israel, God affirmed that he was their God and they were his people, a relationship that required their complete loyalty (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.4">Jer 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.24.7">24:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.20">Ezek 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.11">14:11</a>). God, the great king, would bless and protect the nation Israel. Israel’s obligation was to keep God’s commands, decrees, and regulations (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5">Exod 19:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.19.8">8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.3">24:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.24.7">7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.15-20">Deut 30:15-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God later formed a covenant with King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.5-16">2 Sam 7:5-16</a>), which pertained to the line of kings promised to Abraham and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.6">Gen 17:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.17.16">16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.11">35:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Years later, at a low point in Israel’s history, the prophet Jeremiah foretold a “new covenant” in Israel’s future (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-33">Jer 31:31-33</a>), in which the ideals of the covenants with Abraham and Israel would finally be realized. Jeremiah’s prophecy found fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ (see <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Luke 22:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-13">Heb 8:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.24">12:24</a>). This new covenant provides the ultimate fulfillment of the previous promises that were made to God’s people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s covenants were motivated by God’s faithful love (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">khesed</span>), which enabled a relationship to continue between God and his people. God initiated this relationship, announced its conditions, and rewarded his people accordingly. These covenants were not rewards but divine gifts. God may exclude people from the covenant relationship (see <a href="?bref=Hos.1.9">Hos 1:9</a>), but he will not break, revoke, or withdraw his covenants. If broken or annulled by the human parties, the covenant could be renewed only through a reapplication of God’s faithful love (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-9">Exod 34:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-33">Jer 31:31-33</a>). But while God’s love preserves the relationship, his grace must not be mocked (<a href="?bref=Isa.54.7-10">Isa 54:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.3">55:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.8">61:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-10">1 Cor 6:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.7">Gal 6:7</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Covenant with Abraham</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Lord had already established a relationship with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-9">Gen 12:1-9</a>) before he made a formal covenant with him (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Gen 15</a>). God took all the initiative: He approached Abraham and spoke to him in a vision. God presented the impossible promise that the old man would have a son through whom his descendants would eventually be as numerous as the stars of heaven. Abraham believed God (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">15:6</a>), and his faith proved to be an act of righteousness (see <a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Hab 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.3">4:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.4.17">17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6">Gal 3:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Gal.3.11">11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.37-38">Heb 10:37-38</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the ancient Near East, kings sometimes granted land or other gifts to loyal subjects. The covenant of <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Genesis 15</a> includes a royal grant (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.18-21">15:18-21</a>) in which God, the king, gave land to Abraham, his subject, as a possession and an inheritance. At the end of that day, Abraham knew that his future—and that of his descendants—was firmly in the hands of the covenant God. Later, the grant would be transferred to his descendants.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God later ratified his covenant with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-22">17:1-22</a>), giving him circumcision as its sign (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.10">17:10</a>) and condition (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9">17:9</a>). The almighty God once again took the initiative (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-2">17:1-2</a>) in granting Abraham an extraordinary privilege. The covenant was not a relationship between equals, yet both partners in the covenant assumed responsibilities. God committed himself voluntarily to Abraham and his descendants, while requiring faithfulness from Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">17:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">9-14</a>). The blessing Abraham received as God’s covenant partner was embodied in the new name that God gave him (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5-6">17:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s covenant with Abraham also applied to his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.15-16">13:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.6-10">17:6-10</a>). It pointed to blessing in the relatively near future when his descendants would possess the land (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.12-16">15:12-16</a>). Much later, Abraham’s faith became a blessing to all through his descendant, Jesus Christ, through whom all the families of the earth can share in God’s blessing on Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">12:3</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rom.4.11-25">Rom 4:11-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.8-9">Gal 3:8-9</a>, <a href="?bref=Gal.3.16">16</a>).</p>

<title>Circumcision</title>
<refs>Gen.17.9-14</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Circumcision</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Circumcision, the removal of the male foreskin, was practiced by a number of cultures in the ancient world (see <a href="?bref=Jer.9.25-26">Jer 9:25-26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God chose circumcision as the sign of a covenant that focuses on descendants. God had promised to make Abraham and his descendants into a great nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">Gen 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.3-6">17:3-6</a>) and to use them to redeem the Gentile nations (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">12:3</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gal.3.8-9">Gal 3:8-9</a>). Circumcision was God’s signature in flesh; it would identify Abraham and his descendants as God’s own people (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">Gen 17:9-14</a>) and remind them to live in faithfulness to the covenant.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although circumcision was applied to adult males when they joined the covenant community (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.23-27">Gen 17:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.48">Exod 12:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.3-7">Josh 5:3-7</a>), it was usually performed on infants (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.4">Gen 21:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.12.3">Lev 12:3</a>), who received God’s promises and membership in the covenant community through their parents. Faith was required in order to receive God’s blessings, however, as can be seen in the differentiation between Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, and Joseph and his brothers. Non-Israelites could also obligate themselves to Israel’s covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.48">Exod 12:48</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.34.15-24">Gen 34:15-24</a>), and circumcision marked their inclusion into the worshiping community (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.12.44">Exod 12:44</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Circumcision would help Israel recognize and remember that they must lay aside natural impurity. God’s people had to be loyal to the covenant, to the family, and to their own marriages. Intermarriage with uncircumcised people who were not of the covenant was a violation of the covenant. Any man who refused to be circumcised (physically <span class="ital">cut</span> in this symbolic way) would be <span class="ital">cut</span> off from the covenant people because of his disobedience to God’s command (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.14">Gen 17:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Circumcision is a symbol of separation from the world, of purity, and of loyalty to the covenant. It provides the powerful metaphor of “circumcision of the heart,” which designates a heart that is committed to God and is inwardly set apart to God, rather than being stubbornly resistant (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.41">Lev 26:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.6">Deut 30:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.4">Jer 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.26">9:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11">Eph 2:11</a>). Circumcision of the heart evidences salvation and fellowship with God (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.31-32">Ezek 18:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25-27">36:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.28-29">Rom 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.11">4:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Jesus Christ established God’s new covenant, he fulfilled the requirements of the old covenant. It is not necessary for Gentile believers to be circumcised, since they are incorporated into the people of God through faith in Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-29">Acts 15:1-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.25-29">Rom 2:25-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Gal 2:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.11-12">Col 2:11-12</a>). One must turn in confidence to God and his promises, lay aside sinful behavior and the customs of the world, and live a new life by faith (see <a href="?bref=Jer.31.33-34">Jer 31:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-17">Rom 8:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16-6.10">Gal 5:16–6:10</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Altars</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The first recorded altar in Scripture was built by Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20-21">Gen 8:20-21</a>), though Cain and Abel gave God an offering (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-5">4:3-5</a>). The patriarchs built numerous altars (see <a href="?bref=Gen.12.7-8">12:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.13.4">13:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.22.9">22:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.25">26:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.33.20">33:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.1">35:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.35.14-15">14-15</a>). These altars designated sacred sites of divine revelation and personal land claims in the Promised Land, both north (in Shechem) and south (in Beersheba). Altars were made of stone, earth, brick, or metal and wood. Their table-like form allowed smoke to rise unhindered. Intended as a memorial or a place for sacrifice, an altar was the most common image of worship in the Old Testament and in the wider ancient world. The typical altar was on a raised platform accessed by a ramp or stairway; this elevated the sacrificial worship toward heaven. The four horns on the corners of many altars (see <a href="?bref=Exod.27.2">Exod 27:2</a>) marked off the sacred space of meeting between divine and human realms. Through sacrifice and burning, the offering was transferred from the visible to the invisible world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus unites the various aspects of the altar imagery in himself as high priest, sacrificial lamb, and altar (see <a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-15">Heb 4:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.24">7:24</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.7.27">27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14">9:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.9.26">26</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.10">10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.10">13:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.13.12">12</a>). Jesus anticipated his own sacrifice in his reference to the blood of martyrs (see <a href="?bref=Matt.23.35">Matt 23:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.50-51">Luke 11:50-51</a>), and the cross serves as the final altar. Thus, the enthroned Lamb in Revelation removes the need for temple and altar (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.22">Rev 21:22</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Infertility</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">With the apparent exception of Leah—and only then for a time—each of the patriarchs’ wives suffered infertility before eventually having children (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.30">Gen 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.21">25:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.29.31">29:31</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-18">1 Sam 1:1-18</a>). Children continued the family line, helped protect the tribe, and provided labor. They ensured that hereditary property would stay within the family, guaranteed assistance in old age, and enacted the proper funeral rites. Infertility was therefore a crushing stigma for a woman (<a href="?bref=Ps.113.9">Ps 113:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.15-16">Prov 30:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.1">Isa 54:1</a>), who understood herself to be created as a vessel of life (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Gen 1:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.20">3:20</a>). It was considered a denial of blessing, design, and desire (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">1:28</a>), and it brought shame (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.7">1 Sam 1:7</a>), ridicule (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.4">Gen 16:4</a>), and vicious jealousy (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.1">30:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, childlessness is a theological issue. Fertility is controlled by the Creator (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.17-18">20:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.30.2">30:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.30.22-23">22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.6">1 Sam 1:6</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.27">27</a>), who causes fertility and infertility according to his purpose and his promises (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.19">Gen 17:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.30.2">30:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.113.9">Ps 113:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.11-20">Luke 1:11-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.19">Rom 4:19</a>). God often chose infertility as a precursor to the birth of a promised or unique child, marking the birth as God’s own work. Childlessness is thus a trial of patience that prompts prayer and faith (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.21">Gen 25:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.11">1 Sam 1:11</a>). Abraham learned to nurture faith in God’s promise long before his child arrived (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.4-6">Gen 15:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-21">17:15-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.20-22">Rom 4:20-22</a>). When a couple has been infertile, a child’s arrival is marked as a special display of God’s faithfulness and creative authority.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s delays are not necessarily denials, but they remind longing men and women to use trials for growth and to see children as a gift that cannot be taken for granted. A childless home can be filled with devotion to God as human expectations are submitted to his will. And for whatever reason, a couple may remain infertile their entire lives. God’s people must not isolate their brothers and sisters who are experiencing infertility but must surround them with love and support.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Blessing</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Before his death, Jacob offered a blessing to each of his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-28">49:1-28</a>), as well as to Joseph’s sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.3-20">Gen 48:3-20</a>), just as his father Isaac had blessed him (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.27-29">27:27-29</a>). Blessing enables, enhances, and enriches life, whereas a curse diminishes it (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.14-39">Lev 26:14-39</a>). A blessing is issued publicly by a benefactor and provides power for prosperity and success. Blessing is essential to covenant relationships in that it guides and motivates the parties to obey the covenant’s stipulations (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.3-13">Lev 26:3-13</a>). Obedience leads to blessing, whereas rebellion brings a curse (see <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deut 28</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The initial realm of blessing is creation, in which God as Creator is the ultimate granter of blessing for animals (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.22">Gen 1:22</a>) and humans (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">1:28</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.104.1-35">Pss 104</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.128.3-4">128:3-4</a>). Humans also serve as channels of divine blessing. Abraham was called to be a blessing to the nations (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2-3">Gen 12:2-3</a>). The institutions of family (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.27-29">27:27-29</a>), government (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.14">1 Kgs 8:14</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.52">52</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.66">66</a>), and religion (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.19">Gen 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.9.22">Lev 9:22</a>) are nurtured, commissioned, and purified through blessing. Israel’s priests mediated God’s blessing to Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.6.24-26">Num 6:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.8">Deut 10:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Three basic characteristics can be observed in Old Testament blessings: (1) They are conveyed from a greater party to a lesser one (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.26">Gen 32:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.6-7">Heb 7:6-7</a>); (2) they are signs of favor that result in well-being and productivity (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.3-7">Deut 28:3-7</a>); and (3) they acknowledge that all power and blessing stems from the Creator. All blessings have their source in God’s love (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.7-8">Deut 7:7-8</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.7.12-15">12-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s blessings in the Old Testament are in striking contrast with those of the pagan religions of antiquity. For pagan religions, fortunes and fertility of flock, family, and fields came about through sympathetic magic in ceremonial observances at their shrines—profane customs that were designed to manipulate the deities to act on their behalf so that the cycle of life could be maintained. In the Old Testament, all life, fertility, and blessing came by God’s decree, for he is the only true and living God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the New Testament, the emphasis of blessing shifts from the material to the spiritual, from the nation to the church, and from the temporal to the eternal (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.25">Matt 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">Eph 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9">1 Pet 3:9</a>). In his death, Jesus carried the consequences of sin’s curse (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>), established God’s Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Matt 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-20">5:3-20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.3-5">John 3:3-5</a>), and blessed its citizens with forgiveness of sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.6-25">Rom 4:6-25</a>). Now believers are called to bless the world (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.27-28">Luke 6:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.14">Rom 12:14</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Isa.19.24">Isa 19:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.13">Zech 8:13</a>).</p>

<title>Death</title>
<refs>Gen.49.29-33</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Death</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Humans are mortal, and death is the natural end of earthly life (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-6">Ps 90:1-6</a>). Human identity began with the earth’s dust being animated by the breath of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gen 2:7</a>). This passive state returns at death as God withdraws his breath and the human body collapses again into dust (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.19">3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.4.19-21">Job 4:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.6-8">Isa 40:6-8</a>). Human life depends entirely and continuously on the Creator of life—his breath is a gift that sustains us in life for as long as he grants it (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.29">Ps 104:29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Death entered the human race by sin and brought ruin to it; death comes suddenly, bringing mourning and an apparent end to hopes and dreams. Death is the severest penalty in human justice. In the Old Testament, the death penalty was a punishment for murder (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.6">Gen 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.21.12">Exod 21:12</a>) or blasphemy (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.16">Lev 24:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.30-33">John 10:30-33</a>)—violations that threatened the living community.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, the opposite of “the land of the living” (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.13">Ps 27:13</a>) was <span class="ital">Sheol,</span> the realm of the dead that was shrouded in darkness and silence (<a href="?bref=Job.10.21-22">Job 10:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.17">Ps 94:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.2.6">Jon 2:6</a>). Yet even in death, God’s people cannot be separated from his presence (see <a href="?bref=Pr.14.32">Prov 14:32</a>). God is sovereign and rules over death (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.39">Deut 32:39</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">While the Old Testament often speaks of death simply in terms of joining one’s ancestors—without specific reference to resurrection (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.49.29-33">Gen 49:29-33</a>)—there are some allusions to resurrection (see <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">Job 19:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.25.6-9">Isa 25:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.19">26:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Dan 12:2</a>). Jewish belief in resurrection seems to have become more widespread during the intertestamental period, and resurrection is a prominent theme in the New Testament. Through Christ, God’s redeemed people will triumph over death (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.54-57">1 Cor 15:54-57</a>), the last enemy to be destroyed (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.26">1 Cor 15:26</a>). Death results from sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12">Rom 5:12</a>), and those who live in sin and refuse to turn to God will be punished in the lake of fire in what is called the second death (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">Rev 21:8</a>). But Christ’s death defeated death, and his resurrection serves as the paradigm for all believers (<a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>). He is the Lord of the living and of the dead (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.9">Rom 14:9</a>). The time of death—when the natural inclination is to mourn—should also be the time of the greatest demonstration of faith, for the recipient of God’s promises has a hope beyond the grave.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Promised Land</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Men and women were given the task of governing the earth and ruling over the creation, both to satisfy their own needs and to bring glory to the Creator (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28-30">Gen 1:28-30</a>). But when humanity fell into sin, they suffered alienation not only from God and their fellow human beings but also from the land on which they lived (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.17-19">3:17-19</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-16">4:3-16</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.5.29">5:29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Then God called Abram to follow him by faith and to receive Canaan as a special homeland, a promised land for his descendants as God’s people (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">12:1-3</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.12.7">7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.13.14-18">13:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.7-21">15:7-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.7-8">17:7-8</a>). Later, after Israel was delivered from Egypt and was established as God’s people at Mount Sinai, they were given possession of the land promised to their fathers.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Continued possession of the land depended on obedience. If Israel violated the covenant, they would experience the covenant’s curses, the most severe of which is exile from the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.32-33">Lev 26:32-33</a>). Eventually, that is what happened: Israel’s persistent rebellion against the Lord resulted in their exile to Assyria and Babylon, the loss of the land, and the destruction of the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-21">25:1-21</a>). But God also promises that when the people repent, “then I will remember my covenant with Jacob . . . and I will remember the land” (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.42">Lev 26:42</a>). During the Exile, Jeremiah and other prophets looked beyond the Exile to a future restoration and return to the land (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.36-44">Jer 32:36-44</a>), which occurred during the reign of Cyrus the Great of Persia (see Ezra; Nehemiah).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The promises for the land await ultimate fulfillment.

When famine afflicted Jacob’s family (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.56-42.5">41:56–42:5</a>), God had already placed Joseph in Egypt to provide for his people through the disaster (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.5">45:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.45.7">7</a>). This famine was particularly severe, but famines were not uncommon in the ancient world (see <a href="?bref=Ruth.1.1">Ruth 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1">2 Sam 21:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1-2">1 Kgs 18:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1-11">Hag 1:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">Acts 11:28</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Hardship in Following God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Sometimes people are urged to accept Christ because “he will solve your problems.” But Christ did not promise to solve all of people’s problems. In fact, he repeatedly warned people to consider what it would cost to follow him (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Luke.14.28">Luke 14:28</a>), and he pointed out the hardships that would come into their lives as a result of choosing to follow him (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.8.34">Mark 8:34</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=Exod.5.1-23">Exodus 5</a> gives us a case study: Pharaoh’s earlier enslavement and persecution of the Hebrews was purely strategic. He worried that this growing sector of the population would cause trouble for him (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.8-22">Exod 1:8-22</a>). In chapter <a href="?bref=Exod.5.1-23">5</a>, the situation is different. Moses and Aaron had rallied the people’s hopes that their God would soon rescue them (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.29-31">4:29-31</a>). During their initial encounter with Pharaoh, Moses and Aaron confronted him with the reality of God’s sovereign rule (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.1-3">5:1-3</a>). Not surprisingly, Pharaoh considered this an affront to his own sovereignty and reacted strongly against the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.4-21">5:4-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When God’s Kingdom clashes with God’s enemies, there is often conflict and hardship for God’s people. We should not be surprised. Believers have changed allegiance from the realm of darkness to the realm of light (<a href="?bref=Col.1.11-14">Col 1:11-14</a>), and those who rule in the realm of darkness will certainly not let us leave their power without a fight.

<title>Hardened Hearts</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Hardened Hearts</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Exodus repeatedly states that the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.21">Exod 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.12">9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.10.1">10:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.10.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.11.10">11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.14.4">14:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.14.8">8</a>). These statements can be troubling. Was Pharaoh forced to sin against God?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Other factors need to be taken into account: (1) The Lord knew ahead of time that Pharaoh would harden his heart (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.19">3:19</a>); (2) Pharaoh himself became stubborn (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.15">8:15</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.8.32">32</a>); and (3) Pharaoh remained stubborn despite clear warnings (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.19">8:19</a>). Pharaoh was not a well-meaning, misguided individual who was not allowed to repent. Although God was ultimately in control of Pharaoh, Pharaoh himself was accountable for his actions.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This interplay between human choice and divine sovereignty is found in other places in Scripture. The Israelites hardened their hearts and refused to believe God in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.8-10">Ps 95:8-10</a>). God hardened the hearts of the Canaanites so that they did not seek to make peace with the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.20">Josh 11:20</a>). The message God gave to Isaiah hardened the hearts of his hearers (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.9-10">Isa 6:9-10</a>); similarly in the New Testament, many people hardened their hearts in response to the message of the gospel (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.15">Matt 13:15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.40">John 12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.27">Acts 28:27</a>). People are responsible for their choices, but no one makes choices in a vacuum. Rather, they make them in the context of how God has made his world and providentially directs it.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The emphasis in Exodus on God’s control of Pharaoh puts the conflict between two belief systems into stark contrast. Pharaoh believed that he was sovereign and divine, able to do whatever he pleased. God demonstrated that this was not the case: Pharaoh was dependent, as much the prisoner of his choices as any other creature on the planet. There is only one absolutely independent “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>,” and that is Yahweh, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> (see <a href="?bref=Exod.3.6-14">3:6-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.2-8">6:2-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.2">20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">34:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.3-7">Isa 45:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.17">48:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mark 14:62</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.23-28">John 8:23-28</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Exodus as History</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Israel’s understanding of reality was radically different from that of all other ancient cultures. All of the other major cultures surrounding Israel—from Sumer in southern Mesopotamia in 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> to Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 200—reached their view of reality by observing nature. They concluded that there were many gods and that all events go in unending cycles. Ancient Israel, by contrast, believed that there is one God who is distinct from the world, who made the world with purpose, and who is guiding its events to realize his purposes. How did the Israelites come to their unique concept of reality? Was it not through encounters with the true God in actual events of history? The most reasonable explanation for the distinctiveness of Israel’s understanding is that, as the Bible describes, God broke into their experience and showed himself to them in events that have been recorded as history.</p>
<p class="theme-body">There is no report in Egyptian texts of the events the Bible describes, which has raised suspicions for many. But it would have been highly unusual at that time for a world power to report on their defeat at the hands of a group of slaves. The Bible’s historical reporting, with its inclusion of stories of Israel’s own disasters, is unlike anything else found in the ancient Near East.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Archaeology cannot prove that certain events happened, but it can demonstrate that conditions would have permitted the events to occur, and that is true of the book of Exodus and of the Bible in general. Egyptian records and archaeology neither confirm nor contradict the Bible’s record. However, the text of Exodus shows an intimate familiarity with Egyptian thought and culture, just as a historical record would.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The writers of the Bible believed they were reporting actual events, and they expected their readers to understand them as such. <a href="?bref=Exod.18.8-12">Exodus 18:8-12</a> gives the first example of someone who put his faith in God because of a testimony to what had actually happened. Faith in God and in his inspired word, the Bible, has a strong historical basis. God has entered into history to act for the salvation of humanity. His acts include Israel’s exodus from Egypt and climax in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Purpose of the Sinai Covenant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Nearly everything the Israelites had learned about ultimate reality from the Egyptians was wrong. There are not many gods; there is only one God. The Creator is perfectly good, and evil is the result of rebellion against him. God’s blessings cannot be obtained through magic and manipulation; instead, they are free to those who lovingly submit to him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Upon leaving Egypt, the Israelites did not yet know God in the way that he intended. In the plagues and the Red Sea crossing, they learned of God’s unique power. In the wilderness, they learned about God’s providential care. But they still did not know God’s character. The covenant at Sinai was designed to teach the Israelites about God’s nature and character as they lived out his <span class="hebrew">Torah</span><span class="ital">,</span> his instructions.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The covenant used a familiar political form, the <span class="ital">suzerain-vassal treaty,</span> in which a great king (the <span class="ital">suzerain</span>) made a treaty with a nation he had subjected as a <span class="ital">vassal</span> people. In such a treaty, the conquered people would declare their absolute loyalty to the king and obedience to his demands. The king, for his part, would promise to care for the conquered people and protect them from any enemies who might attack them. In the covenant at Sinai, God called the people to absolute loyalty to himself as the only God and to a life that reflected his will and nature as their sovereign Creator.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God wanted a very simple and straightforward response of obedience from the Israelites. But ever since the Fall (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gen 3</a>), there has been something fundamentally wrong with the human spirit. Simple obedience was thus impossible for the Israelites, whose hearts were unchanged. The covenant was a good thing, but it was weak in that it was incapable of making the Israelites able to follow it (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.12">Rom 7:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.3">8:3</a>). Unless God graciously bestows his Spirit upon us, we will never be able to do the things we must do; we will never share the character of the Creator. Now, through the cross of Christ, God has made it possible for us to be empowered by the Spirit and thus to fulfill his covenant purpose by sharing his holy character.</p>

<title>Ancient Law Codes</title>
<refs>Exod.20.1-23.19</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Ancient Law Codes</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Until the late 1800s, the law of Moses was believed to be a unique code of law, existing nearly a thousand years before anything comparable in Greek and Roman laws. Excavations in Persia in the late 1800s, however, uncovered laws set forth by the Babylonian king Hammurabi in the 1700s <span class="era">BC</span>, some 300 years prior to Moses. Surprisingly, a number of the laws in that list are almost identical to those in the Bible. Though this seemed to imply that the biblical laws had been taken from Hammurabi, subsequent discoveries produced law codes preceding Hammurabi’s by at least 500 years, and several laws are common to all of them, so Hammurabi also did not originate them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">What does this mean for the Bible? First, it is not surprising that we find similar laws from cultures neighboring Israel; similar societies require similar codes of conduct in order to ensure justice. Second, the biblical laws are unique in that they are incorporated in a covenant with God. Elsewhere in the ancient Near East, religious laws (about sacrifice, prayers, offerings, etc.) and civil laws (covering theft, lying, sexual conduct, murder, etc.) were completely unrelated because ethics and religion were considered separate domains. Religion was a matter of prayer, devotion, offerings, and ritual behavior—the territory of priests. Ethics concerned social and civil behavior—the business of the king. The biblical view of things is different: God is sovereign over both religion and society. So a person who is in a relationship with the true God must not only participate in proper worship (religion) but also treat other people rightly (ethics).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Israel’s covenant with God made use of existing forms but invested them with new meaning. For example, the basic layout of Israel’s Tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.1-27.21">Exod 26–27</a>) and Temple (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1-7.51">1 Kgs 6:1–7:51</a>) were the same as elsewhere in the ancient world, and the basic forms of the Hebrew sacrifices (see <a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-7.38">Lev 1–7</a>) were largely identical to the forms of pagan sacrifices. But the meaning and purpose of the Temple and the sacrifices were significantly different from the meaning and purpose of such things in paganism (see study notes on <a href="?item=Exod.20.3-17_StudyNote_Filament">Exod 20:3-17</a>; <a href="?item=Exod.25.1-40.38_StudyNote_Filament">25:1–40:38</a>; <a href="?item=Lev.1.1-7.38_StudyNote_Filament">Lev 1:1–7:38</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">While many of the laws of Moses were not new to the world at that time, the idea that the behavior they called for is written into the very fabric of the universe by its Creator was radically new.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Glory of God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="ital">Glory</span> has a rather different connotation in the Old Testament than it does in English usage. The English word suggests something thin and passing—the glory of a sunset, the glory of last year’s winning team. The root idea of the Hebrew word for <span class="ital">glory</span> is “heaviness” or “solidity.” It connotes “significance” or “worth,” the absolute opposite of “vanity” or “nothingness.” When God’s glory appears, it is not merely a bright light or a glittering cloud, but a visible expression of his absolute reality.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s glory is the manifestation of his person, his power, and his majesty (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.28">Ezek 1:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.4">10:4</a>). God’s glory may be revealed in nature, such as in a thunderstorm (<a href="?bref=Job.37.2-5">Job 37:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.3">Ps 29:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.29.7">7</a>) or in the plagues sent on the Egyptians (<a href="?bref=Num.14.21-22">Num 14:21-22</a>). God’s glory can also be a unique manifestation, such as the revelation on Mount Sinai (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.24">Deut 5:24</a>). When the Tabernacle and Solomon’s Temple were dedicated, God’s glory filled those structures (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-35">Exod 40:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>), indicating his approval of them and that his presence would now reside there. Similarly, the glory of the Lord sent the fire that kindled the first sacrifices of the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Lev.9.22-24">Lev 9:22-24</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When God reveals his glory to his creation (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.24.16-18">Exod 24:16-18</a>), it is often called a <span class="ital">theophany</span>. God gives limited (or veiled) glimpses of his glory because no one can see God and live (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.18-23">Exod 33:18-23</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Isa.6.5">Isa 6:5</a>). To “give glory” to God (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.19">Josh 7:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.15">Isa 24:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.16">Jer 13:16</a>) means to speak or act in a manner that acknowledges who God is.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Christ is the glory and image of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4">2 Cor 4:4</a>), and he was glorified in his death and resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.17.1-5">John 17:1-5</a>). When Christ appears again at last, he will further manifest God’s glory in his restored Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.11">Rev 21:11</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.21.23">23</a>). Paul declares that the presence of Christ in the lives of believers provides assurance that we will share in that glory (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.2">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Col 1:27</a>).</p>

<title>The Plagues</title>
<refs>Exod.7.3-11.10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Plagues</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Rescuing the Hebrew people from oppression by the Egyptians was not the main purpose of the plagues. If that had been the case, one climactic miracle would have been sufficient. The real purpose of the plagues was to communicate who God is—to Israel, to Egypt, and to the surrounding nations.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Israelites had likely lost sight of who God was. They had lived for hundreds of years in Egypt, one of the most polytheistic cultures the world has ever known. Whatever the Israelites may have believed about God when they arrived in Egypt, they were certainly infected with the prevailing pagan views during their sojourn there (see <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Exod 32</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The plagues revealed the Lord’s absolute superiority over everything in creation. These cataclysmic events were specifically aimed at elements the Egyptians revered and worshiped:</p>
<p class="theme-body">1. <span class="ital">The Nile Turned to Blood</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.14-25">7:14-25</a>): The Nile, revered as a god who gave Egypt life and fertility, became a bloody representation of death.</p>
<p class="theme-body">2. <span class="ital">Frogs</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.1-15">8:1-15</a>): The Egyptians revered frogs (represented by Heqet, frog-headed goddess of fruitfulness) as having the key of life beyond death. Now frogs filled the land with the stink of death.</p>
<p class="theme-body">3. <span class="ital">Gnats</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.16-19">8:16-19</a>): The “finger of God” fell on the land with a plague of biting insects that came from the earth, revealing God’s power over Geb, the Egyptian god of the earth.</p>
<p class="theme-body">4. <span class="ital">Flies</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.20-32">8:20-32</a>): The Lord made “a clear distinction” between Israel and Egypt when swarms of biting flies (revered as embodying life from death) filled the land and tormented the Egyptians, including Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="theme-body">5. <span class="ital">Death of Livestock</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.1-7">9:1-7</a>): The Egyptians revered cattle as divine, having the power of life and fertility; Amon-Re, the chief god of Egypt, was pictured as a bull. The “hand of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” struck them, demonstrating his sovereign power.</p>
<p class="theme-body">6. <span class="ital">Festering Boils</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.8-12">9:8-12</a>): God struck the Egyptians with this plague of burning sores, which the Egyptian goddess of healing, Sekhmet, was evidently powerless to ameliorate.</p>
<p class="theme-body">7. <span class="ital">Hail</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.13-35">9:13-35</a>): The Egyptian god Osiris, who represented vegetation, was unable to prevent the Lord from destroying it, because “the earth belongs to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">8. <span class="ital">Locusts</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.1-20">10:1-20</a>): The Lord directed the wind and sent locusts to destroy the last of the vegetation, and with it any hope in Osiris to restore Egypt’s crops.</p>
<p class="theme-body">9. <span class="ital">Darkness</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.21-29">10:21-29</a>): The Lord demonstrated complete, sovereign control over Re, the sun god and king of the Egyptian gods, considered the father of mankind. No power in Egypt could stand against the Lord and his purposes.</p>
<p class="theme-body">10. <span class="ital">Death of the Firstborn</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.1-12.30">11:1–12:30</a>): The Lord took away life itself—which the Egyptians revered above all else—from the heir of every family in Egypt, while preserving and rescuing Israel through the blood sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Thus Yahweh demonstrated to both the Egyptians and the Israelites that he alone is God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The plagues are often referred to as “signs,” just as Jesus’ miracles were (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.7.3">7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.10.1-2">10:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.23">John 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.48">4:48</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.37">12:37</a>). The plagues show that worshiping created things brings God’s judgment. Jesus’ miracles, on the other hand, show that all that is deadly in creation—illness, the demonic, nature run amok, and even death itself—can be overcome by God’s gift of life.</p>

<title>The Passover</title>
<refs>Exod.11.1-13.16</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Passover</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The festival of Passover became a central feature of Israelite religious practice. This festival, which celebrated God’s deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt and his sparing of them from the final, deadly plague, was to be commemorated on an annual basis, in accorance with the instructions given in Exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-27">Exod 12:1-27</a>). Passover was to serve as a reminder across the generations of God’s saving activity. As such, it was an enacted, participatory festival, in which the people ate only unleavened bread, just as they had done in their hurried departure from Egypt.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In that first Passover, a lamb was sacrificed that took the place of the firstborn son of every family of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.12-13">Exod 12:12-13</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.12.23">23</a>). Passover thus carries the notion that we can be delivered from death only by means of a sacrifice that takes our place. But while Passover marked an event of tremendous significance in Israelite history, the events of the Exodus did not conquer the universal, fundamental problem of death, a problem that stems from sin (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.56">1 Cor 15:56</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Many years later, around the time of the Passover festival, Jesus Christ gave his life as “a ransom for many” (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Matt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mark 10:45</a>) and became “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">John 1:29</a>). While sharing a final Passover meal with his disciples, Jesus spoke of the symbolic nature of the wine they shared: “This is my blood, which confirms the covenant. . . . It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Matt 26:28</a>). He embodies and enacts a new Passover: Through his sacrifice, sin and death were fully and finally defeated (see also <a href="?bref=Isa.25.7-8">Isa 25:7-8</a>).</p>

<title>The Tabernacle</title>
<refs>Exod.25.1-31.11</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Tabernacle</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">From the very beginning of creation, God’s plan was to share his life with humanity and allow people to enjoy fellowship with him. However, the entry of sin into the world (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gen 3</a>) created a serious obstacle, for if sinful people were to come into the presence of God, his holiness would destroy them. The Tabernacle provided a temporary means by which the Israelites could enjoy God’s presence without being destroyed by it (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.8">Exod 25:8</a>). The Tabernacle was a mobile sanctuary where God dwelled with his people and was the place where Israel made sacrifices and offerings in worship of the Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Tabernacle shows us in tangible ways what is required to enter God’s presence. The altar shows us that sin must be removed through a sacrificial death. The washbasin shows that fellowship with God demands removing uncleanness, that is, anything that conflicts with God’s ethical perfection. In the Holy Place, the lampstand and the table show that we must walk in God’s light and rely on him to provide for our needs. The incense altar represents prayer, and the constantly rising incense reminds those who are forgiven and washed, who are walking in his light and relying constantly on him, that they have unlimited access to him. The curtain between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place reminds us that the Almighty, the holy God who invites us into fellowship, cannot be approached casually. Behind the curtain is the glorious Ark of the Covenant, over which God’s glory appeared, symbolizing his enthronement as Israel’s king. The centrality of the Ark reflects God’s central purpose for his people—a covenant relationship with the living God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Our new covenant relationship with God is made possible by Jesus’ perfect sacrifice for sin and his ministry as our high priest before God (see especially <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1-10.39">Heb 9–10</a>). He has fulfilled the requirements that are illustrated by the ancient Tabernacle, and we can now approach God’s throne with boldness and confidence (see <a href="?bref=Eph.3.12">Eph 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-16">Heb 4:14-16</a>).</p>

<title>Community Identity</title>
<refs>Lev.4.3-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Community Identity</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In modern Western society, the individual is considered to be the primary social entity. In Israel, by contrast, an individual’s identity and significance were determined by his or her membership in the community. All Israelites were expected to partake of the common identity of the community as the “children of Israel” and to embody the characteristics that marked the whole.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, the people are often referred to or addressed in the singular, emphasizing their oneness. The Decalogue (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-17">Exod 20:2-17</a>) and the blessing of Aaron (<a href="?bref=Num.6.24-26">Num 6:24-26</a>), for example, are given in the singular. The individual could often represent the group, and the group could be referred to as an individual. Nehemiah, for example, asks forgiveness for the sins that caused the exile to Babylon as though he had been one of those transgressors (“we have sinned,” <a href="?bref=Neh.1.6-7">Neh 1:6-7</a>). Nehemiah was governor of Judea from 445 to 433 <span class="era">BC</span>, about 140 years after the destruction of Jerusalem (586 <span class="era">BC</span>), so he did not participate in the sins leading to the Exile. Yet in his prayer, he identifies with his people in their sinfulness. In this same way, the high priest could represent the entire people on the Day of Atonement (see <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lev 16</a>). Because the individual Israelite was so strongly identified with the community, the sin of the individual would become the sin of the community if not addressed (see <a href="?bref=Lev.4.3-21">Lev 4:3-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-5">20:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In like manner, the Christian community is described as the “body of Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27">1 Cor 12:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.12">Eph 4:12</a>). The members partake of Christ’s identity through the Holy Spirit. That is, as the body of Christ they manifest Christ’s life in their lives, and as a unified whole they reveal him to the world. Paul exhorts the Galatians to share the burdens of others (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.2">Gal 6:2</a>) and so to model Christ’s example (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.28-30">Matt 11:28-30</a>).</p>

<title>God’s Instructions</title>
<refs>Lev.6.8-7.38</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Instructions</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The common Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">torah</span> is translated “law” in most English versions. This translation comes from the use of the Greek word <span class="greek">nomos</span> (which means “law”) to translate <span class="hebrew">torah</span> in the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament). However, <span class="hebrew">torah</span> is better understood as “teaching,” “instruction,” or “doctrine.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">The term <span class="ital">law</span> often brings to mind an authority imposed by an external force (such as a government) and is often perceived as harsh and unbending. The <span class="hebrew">torah</span> of Moses, however, is instructional. It might embody law, but it also included stories (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-3">Lev 10:1-3</a>), poetry (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.1-43">Deut 32:1-43</a>), genealogies (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.14-25">Exod 6:14-25</a>), and a number of other literary forms.</p>
<p class="theme-body">There are other words properly translated “law,” and these are included within the body of instruction given to the Israelites. For example, <span class="hebrew">khoq</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “statute,” refers to a law as it was given by the lawgiver—in this case, by God himself (e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.6.22">Lev 6:22</a>). It states a general principle, leaving its application open to interpretation by context or the courts. In <a href="?bref=Lev.18.4-5">Leviticus 18:4-5</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.19.37">19:37</a>, <span class="hebrew">khuqqah</span> (“decrees”) is paired with <span class="hebrew">mishpatim</span> (“regulations”), a term indicating case laws. It would be impossible to write laws that cover every situation. A case law, therefore, refers to a court’s previous interpretation of a statute in certain cases; the court’s decisions in the past give guidance for deciding on similar cases in the present.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Law is necessary, for there will always be people who need its restraint. And much of the content in the Torah can properly be described as “law.” But in a more general sense, the Torah allows God’s people to be instructed in who he is and who they are to be in light of that. Similarly, instruction in doctrine and godly living are an integral part of the church and its life-giving message to the world (<a href="?bref=Col.3.16">Col 3:16</a>).</p>

<title>God’s Absolute Holiness</title>
<refs>Lev.10.1-3</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Absolute Holiness</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Holiness is the fundamental descriptor of who God is. It is not merely one of his many attributes; it is the key to his very being. Calling God “the Holy One” speaks to the transcendence of his nature, in sharp contrast to the finite creation, whose creatures are bound by time and space. God speaks of himself as “<span class="divine-name">I Am Who I Am</span>” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.14">Exod 3:14</a>), defining himself by himself. God is the Wholly Other, the One who is completely self-sufficient and distinct from the created order.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s holiness also speaks of his character. It is common to describe God’s holiness in terms of his separation from sin and his wrath against it, but the notion of holiness embraces all of God’s character, including his mercy. God revealed himself to Moses as the “God of compassion and mercy.” He said, “I am slow to anger and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.” In his holiness, God shows this “unfailing love to a thousand generations. I forgive iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But I do not excuse the guilty” (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">Exod 34:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s holiness can be deadly to uninvited intruders (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Isa 6:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.6.5">5</a>; see <a href="?bref=Exod.28.35">Exod 28:35</a>) or to those who treat it with contempt. His infinite holiness is too much for finite, fallen mortals and would utterly destroy them apart from God’s mercy. Understanding God’s holiness should thus trigger a response of awe and reverence. Anything less would be profane. Perhaps this was the error that cost Nadab and Abihu their lives (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-3">Lev 10:1-3</a>). Only in recognizing the awesomeness of God can we appreciate his great love for us and worship him appropriately and authentically.</p>

<refs>Lev.11.1-15.33</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Clean, Unclean, and Holy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The rites and regulations establishing cleanness and uncleanness were to distinguish Israel from the surrounding nations. To understand a rationale behind these regulations, one suggestion has been that unclean things are associated with death or the ground (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1">Lev 21:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.21.11">11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.8">22:8</a>). Recent studies, however, suggest the principle of “normalcy.” God is a God of order. Things that are normal in God’s order are called “clean” and are “permitted.” Abnormal things would be unfit for food or offerings and would be “unclean.” A normal land animal would be a vegetarian (see <a href="?bref=Gen.1.30">Gen 1:30</a>). A normal human body would have no infections or discharges. A normal piece of cloth would have no mildew on it. If abnormalities occurred, the animal, person, or cloth was unclean.</p>
<p class="theme-body">What is unclean is not sinful but represents a kind of unworthiness that cannot come in contact with what is holy (e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.11.44-45">Lev 11:44-45</a>). If it is cleansed, it acquires the potential for holiness; it may be dedicated to God and become holy. If what is holy (such as the Sabbath) is treated like something common, God is blasphemed and the thing is profaned. If what is clean becomes unclean, it is defiled and requires cleansing. Some things, such as unclean animals, fish, or birds, remain unclean by definition and can never be cleansed, and, thus, can never become holy.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the new covenant, things that were previously unclean have been declared clean (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.15">Acts 10:15</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.28">28</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.45">45</a>). Yet God is still a God of order (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.33">1 Cor 14:33</a>) and wants worship to be conducted in an orderly way (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.40">1 Cor 14:40</a>). While God’s grace is abundant to repentant sinners, some things are still repulsive to his holiness and should never be brought into his presence (e.g., Ananias and Sapphira’s offering; see <a href="?bref=Acts.5.1-11">Acts 5:1-11</a>).</p>

<title>Holiness by Relationship</title>
<refs>Lev.11.44-45</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Holiness by Relationship</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Holiness refers to God’s transcendent character (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.3">Lev 10:3</a>). How can we, finite creatures who have fallen into sin, be holy as God is holy?</p>
<p class="theme-body">We can never become transcendent like God. We will always be finite creatures, and our holiness cannot be absolute the way God’s holiness is. Thus our holiness does not refer to our own nature and character. Instead, it refers to our relationship with God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">When God declares a place to be holy, it is because he manifests himself there (see <a href="?bref=Exod.3.5">Exod 3:5</a>); if his presence is withdrawn, the place reverts to being ordinary. When God declares an object to be holy, such as an altar (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.44-46">Exod 29:44-46</a>), it is because it was built in the manner prescribed by God and has been accepted by God for his service. Its relationship to God makes it holy as nothing else could.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It is the same for people. We are told to be holy because God is holy (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lev 19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.15-16">1 Pet 1:15-16</a>). Such holiness can only be imputed to humans. Without a relationship with God, true holiness remains elusive, no matter how good, pious, or disciplined a person’s life might be. Only God can make people holy (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.13">Exod 31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.8">Lev 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.32">22:32</a>). God promises to be with his people and make their holiness possible (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.9">Hos 11:9</a>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.35.8-10">Isa 35:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The church, like Israel of the Old Testament, shares a relationship with God. Our adoption as God’s children allows us to become godly people (see <a href="?bref=Exod.4.22">Exod 4:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.14">Rom 8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.26">Gal 3:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.2">1 Jn 3:2</a>). The atoning death of Jesus, the Holy One, makes it possible for all who call on him by faith to enjoy a right relationship with him (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Rom 5:12-21</a>), which serves as the basis of our holiness (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.11">1 Cor 6:11</a>). We can be holy in our standing with God as well as in our conduct toward other people—but only through our connection to the holy God.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Atonement</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Leviticus 16 describes the Day of Atonement. On this day, the high priest presented the sins of the community to the Lord. Worshiping a holy God requires atonement, the removal of any uncleanness or sin that stands in the way. God’s grace permitted the death of an animal to be accepted in exchange for the sinner’s life. In the atoning offerings, the sacrifice represented the life of the worshiper: The animal was sacrificed so that the worshiper might live. God designated the blood of the sacrifice—blood represents life—as the means of atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.11">Lev 17:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Atonement provides both <span class="ital">expiation</span> and <span class="ital">propitiation.</span> Expiation is the payment of what is owed. For example, the guilt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.14-6.7">5:14–6:7</a>) involves damages or loss to property, and the loss must be repaid with a 20 percent surcharge. Propitiation, on the other hand, involves appeasing or pacifying an offended party. For example, the whole burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-17">1:1-17</a>) and the sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.1-5.13">4:1–5:13</a>) require no discernable payment of a debt.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the atoning sacrifices, the act of laying hands on the victim (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.4-35">4:4-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.16.21">16:21</a>) indicates identification of the worshiper with the animal being sacrificed. The blood, representing the life of the animal (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.14">17:14</a>), is presented in place of the life of the worshiper (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.11">17:11</a>). The animal is killed, and its blood and certain parts are ceremonially presented to God, thus cleansing the worshiper and averting God’s wrath.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The blood of Jesus brings atonement (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.20">Col 1:20</a>) and obtains eternal redemption for believers (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.12">Heb 9:12</a>). Christ, God’s lamb, reconciles us to God (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">John 1:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14">Heb 9:14</a>). He paid our debt of sin (expiation) and satisfied God’s judgment against us (propitiation).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Family, Community, and Sexual Sin</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In Israel, the family was the basic building block for the solidarity of the entire people. Each of the twelve tribes was a conglomeration of families and clans. The twelve tribes together comprised the people of Israel as a whole. Although the level of solidarity might decrease at a distance from one’s immediate family, this familial notion permeated all of Israelite society. A kinsman was often called a brother, not just a relative, to express the close intimacy. By extension of the family model, the term often translated “brother” could also be used of a fellow Israelite (see <a href="?bref=Deut.1.16">Deut 1:16</a>, “fellow Israelites”; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.18">Deut 3:18</a>, “Israelite relatives”).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Since Israel was seen as an extended family, its existence depended on the integrity of the home. Crimes such as incest and adultery were punished very severely because they weakened the foundation of the family. Incest introduced competition, threatening the safety of the home by violating the trust, intimacy, and sense of belonging shared by its members. Adultery fragmented the home by allowing intimacy with someone outside it to divide the loyalties of its participants. These powerful enemies of family solidarity weakened the clan and tribe (see <a href="?bref=Lev.18.6-23">Lev 18:6-23</a>) and, by extension, the solidarity of the nation itself.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Sexual sins—even those that are consensual—are not “victimless crimes” but sins that eventually threaten the community itself. The importance given in Old Testament law to such crimes is echoed in New Testament warnings against sexual immorality (see especially <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-2">1 Cor 5:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.13-20">6:13-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.2">7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-21">Gal 5:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.3">Eph 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.7">Jude 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.14-16">Rev 2:14-16</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.2.20">20</a>).</p>

<title>Concern for the Poor</title>
<refs>Lev.23.22</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Concern for the Poor</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God commanded Israel to show concern for its people’s well-being. Israel’s covenant with God, together with its self-concept as an extended family, exerted a leveling effect that resisted pretensions to privilege. A family should provide for members who are facing difficulty. These members of the Israelite people included widows and orphans (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.22">Exod 22:22</a>), the poor, and foreigners (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.10">Lev 19:10</a>). The edges of the fields and the gleanings of field and vineyard were to be left for the needy (see <a href="?bref=Lev.23.22">Lev 23:22</a>). Those who were destitute were not to be victimized. Instead, loans were to be made without interest, or the debtor was to be allowed to work off his debt with dignity as a bondservant (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.35-42">25:35-42</a>). These positive steps ensured that the poor had food to eat.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Bible first mentions concern for the poor in the radical accommodations of the offering system to those unable to afford more costly offerings. Birds could be substituted for lambs in the whole burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.14-17">1:14-17</a>) and the sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.7-10">5:7-10</a>), and there were other such concessions in the cleansing rituals (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.21-22">14:21-22</a>). Perhaps the most striking is in the substitution of flour for the sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.11-13">5:11-13</a>). The life-for-a-life symbolism is forfeited for economic reasons, showing clearly God’s desire that the poor who cannot afford a lamb should nonetheless be able to experience forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This theme is continued in the prophets’ concern for the poor and helpless and their pleas for social justice and compassion (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.1.17">Isa 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.6">Amos 2:6</a>). The prophets had some strong words for those responsible for oppressing the needy (see e.g., <a href="?bref=Amos.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.4-8">8:4-8</a>). The worship practices of the people—no matter how lavish—were not accepted by God if, at the same time, those worshiping were guilty of injustice and oppression (see <a href="?bref=Isa.1.15-20">Isa 1:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.6-8">Mic 6:6-8</a>). This notion that proper attitudes and actions toward God and others are more important than the practice of worship rituals is reflected in the story in the Gospels of the poor widow’s offering. Her offering receives praise from Jesus, not because of its monetary value, but because of the devotion it represented (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.41-44">Mark 12:41-44</a>). Religious practices could even inhibit helping those in need (see <a href="?bref=Mark.7.9-13">Mark 7:9-13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Both Jesus and the early church exhibited concern for the poor. Jesus indicated that a major component of his mission was to bring hope to the poor and release for the oppressed (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-21">Luke 4:16-21</a>). He warned strongly against neglecting the poor (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Luke 16:19-31</a>) and indicated that a willingness to provide for the poor was necessary for those desiring to be his followers (see <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-23">Luke 18:18-23</a>). Reflecting the teaching of Christ, the early church sought to ensure that the needy among them were well cared for (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.44-45">Acts 2:44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.32-37">Acts 4:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.3-16">1 Tim 5:3-16</a>). As in the prophets, the mistreatment of the marginalized made a farce of religious practice (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.17-29">1 Cor 11:17-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.27-2.17">Jas 1:27–2:17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s concern for the poor is thus a theme that runs throughout Scripture, and believers must take up a similar perspective toward those in need.</p>

<p class="theme-body-fl">The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">kherem</span> (“specially set apart”) is difficult to translate because it represents a concept for which there is no exact parallel in modern English. In the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, <span class="hebrew">kherem</span> designated something that was dedicated to a pagan god and therefore hostile to the Lord. Such things were to be destroyed (see <a href="?bref=Josh.6.18">Josh 6:18</a>). In the case of valuable metal items, they were brought to the sanctuary, where they became holy to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Lev.27.28">Lev 27:28</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Josh.6.19">Josh 6:19</a>, <a href="?bref=Josh.6.24">24</a>).

<p class="theme-body">In <a href="?bref=Lev.27.21">Leviticus 27:21</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.27.28">28</a>, <span class="hebrew">kherem</span> indicates an acceptable vow devoting something to the Lord for use in the sanctuary (see <a href="?bref=Num.18.14">Num 18:14</a>). This made the item, land, or person holy. The thing or person could not be bought back; it remained in the Lord’s service permanently.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The concept of complete dedication through total destruction underlies several passages in the apostle Paul’s writings. In <a href="?bref=Rom.9.3">Romans 9:3</a>, Paul was even willing to be declared <span class="greek">anathema</span> (the Greek equivalent of <span class="hebrew">kherem</span>) if it would bring about the salvation of his fellow Jews. In <a href="?bref=Gal.1.8-9">Galatians 1:8-9</a>, the same Greek word indicates an appropriate end for those who preach a false gospel. In <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.3">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>, Paul warns that no one speaking in the Spirit can call Jesus <span class="greek">anathema</span><span class="ital">,</span> that is, no one who has God’s Spirit will interpret Jesus’ crucifixion as a sign of God’s rejection of him, as the Jews of Paul’s day did. Instead, they will recognize it as an act of atonement for sinful humanity.</p>

<title>The Priestly Blessing</title>
<refs>Num.6.22-27</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Priestly Blessing</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The priestly blessing (<a href="?bref=Num.6.22-27">Num 6:22-27</a>) is one of the most familiar and best-loved passages in the Hebrew Bible. Through the centuries, worshipers have found comfort in its brief but profound lines. This famous text is simple and elegant.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The priestly blessing invokes the Lord’s blessing by repeating his name in each appeal (“the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” = <span class="ital">Yahweh;</span> see <a href="?item=Exod.3.15_StudyNote_Filament">study note on Exod 3:15</a>). The repetition of God’s name reminds God’s people of his interest and involvement in their lives. This benediction emphasizes the relationship between God and his people and helps them to remember the source of their blessings.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Many Old Testament passages refer to blessings pronounced by God and by people (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gen 12:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-40">27:1-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.12-15">Deut 7:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-14">28:1-14</a>). The Israelites needed God’s blessings—his help and favor—as they prepared to leave Sinai. Although the modern reader tends to think of a blessing in general terms, the Israelites in the wilderness must have understood it in terms of food, water, health, children, protection from enemies, and settlement in the Promised Land. Throughout the book of Numbers, God dealt with Israel through these down-to-earth concerns.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord blessed Israel through the good words of Aaron and his sons, the priests (<a href="?bref=Num.6.22-23">Num 6:22-23</a>). In addition to their work in the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), the priests played an important role in Israelite life. For example, the priests helped administer justice in the land (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.8-12">Deut 17:8-12</a>) and assisted the king in his duties, according to a principle established in <a href="?bref=Deut.17.18-20">Deut 17:18-20</a>. Eli the priest comforted Hannah and took an active role in the spiritual formation of young Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-3.21">1 Sam 1:1–3:21</a>). The priests and Levites were active in Israel’s spiritual instruction (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.33.9-10">Deut 33:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.8.9-12">Neh 8:9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.2.5-9">Mal 2:5-9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">An important archaeological discovery draws attention to the significance of this ancient priestly blessing. In 1980, excavators recovered two small silver scrolls from a rock-cut tomb at Ketef Hinnom, southwest of the Old City of Jerusalem. Scholars date these small amulets to the late 600s or early 500s <span class="era">BC</span>. When these delicate scrolls were unrolled through a lengthy and tedious process, they were found to contain the blessing from <a href="?bref=Num.6.24-26">Num 6:24-26</a> in words that are very close to the text in the Hebrew Bible. In ancient times, such scrolls were sometimes worn as charms, similar in function to the <span class="ital">tefillin,</span> or “phylacteries” or “prayer boxes” (see <a href="?bref=Deut.6.8">Deut 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Matt 23:5</a>). These small scrolls are the earliest manuscripts of the biblical text and contain the earliest reference to <span class="ital">Yahweh,</span> the Old Testament name of God, found in Jerusalem. These artifacts point to the timeless appeal of this brief text.</p>
<p class="theme-body">A number of New Testament letters end with a blessing spoken over the readers in a tone very similar to the priestly blessing of Numbers (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.14">2 Cor 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20-21">Heb 13:20-21</a>).</p>

<title>Bread from Heaven</title>
<refs>Num.11.1-15</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Bread from Heaven</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As the Israelites left Egypt behind and entered the wilderness, God sent manna, a breadlike substance, to sustain them (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.1-36">Exod 16</a>). The Lord gave them food adequate for their daily needs (see <a href="?bref=Neh.9.20-21">Neh 9:20-21</a>). This “bread from heaven” showed God’s people his love and illustrated his special provision for Israel in the wilderness (see <a href="?bref=Deut.8.3">Deut 8:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.8.16">16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.24">Pss 78:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.40">105:40</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rev.2.17">Rev 2:17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although manna was actual food, some passages use the term in a spiritual sense to symbolize a spiritual relationship with the Lord and as a sign of God’s miraculous provision for his people (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.3-4">1 Cor 10:3-4</a>). At the same time, manna was associated with Israel’s complaining against God and with their lack of trust in his provision (<a href="?bref=Num.11.1-15">Num 11:1-15</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.5">1 Cor 10:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Shortly after Jesus had miraculously fed the 5,000 near the Sea of Galilee, he taught in the synagogue at Capernaum about the “bread of life” (<a href="?bref=John.6.22-59">John 6:22-59</a>). He identified himself as the “true bread of God” and “the bread of life” (<a href="?bref=John.6.32-35">John 6:32-35</a>); he even linked eternal life with the need to “eat [his] flesh” and “drink his blood” (<a href="?bref=John.6.50-58">John 6:50-58</a>). Just as the manna provided food in the wilderness, Jesus—the true bread from God—offers spiritual sustenance. Israel was humbled by their need for food in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.3">Deut 8:3</a>). Now followers of Jesus must humble themselves and receive the fullness of his life by faith (<a href="?bref=John.6.35-40">John 6:35-40</a>, <a href="?bref=John.6.47-51">47-51</a>, <a href="?bref=John.6.63-64">63-64</a>).</p>

<title>Spirit Empowerment</title>
<refs>Num.11.11-30</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Spirit Empowerment</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout Scripture, when the need arises, God empowers in special ways those who are committed to his service. The account of Moses and the seventy elders is one early instance, and it reminds us that God has moved and worked among his people in special ways throughout the ages. When Moses reached the end of his patience and his ability to manage rebellious Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.11.1-15">Num 11:1-15</a>), God told him to select seventy men to help him (<a href="?bref=Num.11.16-17">11:16-17</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Exod.18.14-26">Exod 18:14-26</a>). Then the Lord redistributed the Spirit that Moses already possessed and empowered these men for service (<a href="?bref=Num.11.24-25">Num 11:24-25</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Joshua was empowered by the Lord’s Spirit as Moses’ successor (<a href="?bref=Num.27.18">Num 27:18</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Deut.34.9">Deut 34:9</a>). In the period of the Judges, the Spirit of the Lord came to the aid of Israel’s leaders as, for example, in the work of Othniel (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.10">Judg 3:10</a>), Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.34">Judg 6:34</a>), Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.29">Judg 11:29</a>), and Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.25">Judg 13:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.6">14:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.14.19">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.14">15:14</a>). David had access to the strength of God’s presence, and his awareness of God’s actions—in history and in his own experience—made him a great leader (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.13">1 Sam 16:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.45">17:45</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.12">18:12</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.28">28</a>). The prophets knew that their special ministry was possible because of the Spirit’s presence and power (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Isa 61:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.5">Ezek 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6">Zech 4:6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus was filled with God’s Spirit and empowered for a unique ministry (see <a href="?bref=Matt.12.18">Matt 12:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1">Luke 4:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.4.14">14</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.34">John 3:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.38">Acts 10:38</a>), and he spoke about the Spirit’s special role in the church (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>). The arrival of the Spirit enabled the assembled believers to speak powerfully on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.4-5">Acts 2:4-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.2.16-18">16-18</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">Joel 2:28-29</a>). The Spirit emboldened and empowered the church after Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.31">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.6">19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-31">1 Cor 12:1-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.2-5">Gal 3:2-5</a>) and remains with God’s people today. The Spirit moves as circumstances require to provide spiritual renewal and strength to God’s people, and the Spirit continues to equip God’s people for whatever tasks he calls them to do.</p>

<title>The Servant-Leader</title>
<refs>Num.12.1-8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Servant-Leader</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">A servant-leader is characterized by an overwhelming desire to accomplish a purpose through serving others. The leader’s heart compels this person to assume a servant role.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Old Testament describes Moses as the Lord’s servant (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.31">Exod 14:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.7-8">Num 12:7-8</a>). Moses did not seek power, prestige, or material gain, but assumed his leadership role reluctantly. He used his prophetic authority with humility (<a href="?bref=Num.12.3">Num 12:3</a>), knowing that he was subject to God (see <a href="?bref=Deut.34.10-12">Deut 34:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.13">Hos 12:13</a>). Every event in Moses’ story from the time he was called by God indicates that he understood his leadership as derived from his service to God. He was submissive, selfless, and faithful. His interactions with his fellow Israelites were characterized by empathy, persuasiveness, and vision. Moses stood in the gap at a critical moment in Israelite history and repeatedly interceded on behalf of the people. Moses’ remarkably humble submission to God served as the basis for his role as a great leader.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus of Nazareth is the ideal servant-leader. The Gospels portray Jesus as the Lord’s “Suffering Servant” (see <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">Isa 52:13–53:12</a>), especially in his sacrificial death, which was his ultimate act of service (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mark 10:45</a>). Jesus spoke with great authority, but did so humbly, understanding his role as a shepherd who sacrifices his life for his sheep (<a href="?bref=John.10.11">John 10:11</a>). He spent time with children and used them as models for those who desire to follow God wholeheartedly (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.4">Matt 18:4</a>). When James and John asked him to give them an elevated rank in his Kingdom, Jesus criticized their worldly ambition (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-45">Mark 10:35-45</a>) and set their priorities straight by instructing them to follow his example of servanthood (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.24-28">Matt 20:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.11-12">23:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.43-45">Mark 10:43-45</a>). As a model for all who want to lead others through a life of service, Jesus understood that his purpose was to bring glory to God’s name (<a href="?bref=John.12.27-28">John 12:27-28</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The apostles Paul and Peter followed Christ’s example and fulfilled his ideal of servant leadership. Paul’s life of service demonstrated humility and tireless efforts on behalf of others (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.23-28">2 Cor 11:23-28</a>). He taught Christians to do the same (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.17">Rom 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.13">Gal 5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">2 Tim 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.3">2:3</a>) and praised those who did so (e.g., <a href="?bref=Phil.2.25-30">Phil 2:25-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.7">Col 4:7</a>).

<p class="theme-title">The Bronze Snake</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Numbers 21:4-9</a> contains one of many incidents in which the Israelites spoke against God and Moses. When the Israelites complained about their lack of food and water and “this horrible manna” (<a href="?bref=Num.21.5">21:5</a>), the Lord sent poisonous snakes that fatally bit many of the people (cp. <a href="?bref=Deut.8.15">Deut 8:15</a>). When the Israelites realized their mistake in speaking against God as well as against Moses, they asked Moses to pray that the Lord would remove the snakes. In response, God instructed Moses to make a bronze replica of a snake; whenever the afflicted would look upon the snake, they would be healed (<a href="?bref=Num.21.8">Num 21:8</a>). What kind of medical treatment was this? The power came from God, but it required an act of faith to look at the bronze image and trust that God would heal. Just as the serpent bites resulted from God’s wrath, the Lord provided deliverance through his own gracious will (see <span class="ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span> 16:5-7).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Hezekiah became king of Judah in 715 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Israelites had begun using Moses’ bronze serpent as an idol (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-4">2 Kgs 18:1-4</a>). They had probably kept the image as a reminder of God’s power, just as they kept other artifacts from the wilderness period (see <a href="?bref=Deut.10.5">Deut 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.4-5">Heb 9:4-5</a>). But they began worshiping it as another deity, so it had to be destroyed like other pagan shrines and sacred pillars. Such idolatry is a serious threat to the worship of the one true God (cp. <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Exod 32</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus referred to the incident of the bronze snake to predict the manner of his execution: He would be “lifted up” on the cross just as Moses had lifted up the snake on a pole (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-15">John 3:14-15</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.8.28">8:28</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.32-33">12:32-33</a>). The metal image of a snake offered an antidote to injected venom; by analogy, those who look at the cross and accept God’s sacrifice lay claim to an eternal promise (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-16">John 3:14-16</a>). The Lord sent the serpents to punish Israel because they complained about the manna God had sent them in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Num 21:4-9</a>). Jesus referred to himself as the “true bread from heaven,” the manna that provides life for his people (<a href="?bref=John.6.32-40">John 6:32-40</a>).</p>

<title>The Cloud and Fire</title>
<refs>Num.9.15-23</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Cloud and Fire</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When Israel was in the wilderness, God led the nation with a pillar of cloud and fire. The pillar joined the Israelites right after the first Passover, immediately after Israel left Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.20-22">Exod 13:20-22</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The pillar served a variety of functions. When the Egyptians pursued the Israelites, the cloud moved behind the people of Israel and prevented an Egyptian advance (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.19-20">Exod 14:19-20</a>). Through the rest of Israel’s travels, it was a visible indication that “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> went ahead of them” (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">Exod 13:21</a>). When the pillar settled over the Tabernacle and the camp of Israel, it represented the Lord’s presence and protection. The cloud and fire also provided divine guidance by indicating when the Israelites should move (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.36-38">Exod 40:36-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.9.17-23">Num 9:17-23</a>). When the pillar was stationary, Israel stayed where they were. When it lifted and moved on, the Israelites broke camp and followed. They camped in different places for varying amounts of time, sometimes briefly and sometimes for a longer period. Israel thus “camped or traveled at the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s command” (<a href="?bref=Num.9.23">Num 9:23</a>). The pillar of cloud and fire was like a divine banner flying over the tribes on the march (cp. <a href="?bref=Num.10.14">10:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.10.18">18</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.10.22">22</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.10.25">25</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The pillar regularly appeared as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="?bref=Num.9.15-16">9:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">Exod 13:21</a>). In the Bible, both fire and clouds often indicate the presence and glory of God (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.19.16-18">Exod 19:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.15-18">24:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.5">Matt 17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.9">Acts 1:9</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Ps.18.8-13">Ps 18:8-13</a>). The cloud and fire imagery indicated that God’s presence and glory moved with Israel through the wilderness. This special manifestation of God (a <span class="ital">theophany</span>) stayed with them “throughout all their journeys” while they were in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.38">Exod 40:38</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Exod.13.22">Exod 13:22</a>). Sometimes, “the cloud covered the Tabernacle, and the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> filled the Tabernacle,” so that “Moses could no longer enter the Tabernacle” (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-35">Exod 40:34-35</a>). On other occasions, the cloud descended and hovered near the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, indicating that the Lord was speaking with Moses “face to face” (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.7-11">Exod 33:7-11</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Num.11.25">Num 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.5">12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31.15">Deut 31:15</a>). The pillar of cloud and fire was a constant, reassuring reminder of the Lord’s presence. We are not given any specific description of the fire and the cloud other than that it was shaped like a pillar; regardless, it was a powerful symbol of God’s special care for Israel (see <a href="?bref=Neh.9.19-21">Neh 9:19-21</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Ps.46.1">Pss 46:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-24">139</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.31-39">Rom 8:31-39</a>).</p>

<title>Biblical Law</title>
<refs>Deut.4.1-8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Biblical Law</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Biblical law is more than lists of dos and don’ts. It is a system of divine expectations regarding belief and behavior which, if faithfully carried out, will bring God’s richest blessing. Life itself depends on keeping the law (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.1">Deut 4:1</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Deut.5.32-33">5:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.20">16:20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The exodus from Egypt freed the nation of Israel to become God’s servant. When God delivered Israel from bondage by “a strong hand, a powerful arm, and terrifying acts” (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.34">4:34</a>), it was not because Israel had earned this right through its own righteousness but because God is gracious and faithful to his promises to Abraham. The purpose of the rescue from Egypt was not just to relieve the Israelites of their onerous burdens (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.11-22">Exod 1:11-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.5.4-23">5:4-23</a>), but to make a covenant with them. The covenant relationship did not make the Israelites God’s people; they already were his people (see <a href="?bref=Exod.4.22-23">Exod 4:22-23</a>). Obedience was not a precondition to the covenant but the proper response to it. It placed on them the responsibility of serving God as a priestly kingdom and a holy nation (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.4-6">Exod 19:4-6</a>). The law was given to regulate Israel’s affairs as a nation so that God’s people would be a beacon of his unfailing love and faithfulness.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The covenant guaranteed the people of Israel abundant and meaningful life if they kept the law. The covenant document consists of broad principles, patterns, and standards. God’s instructions are embodied most famously in the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.6-21">Deut 5:6-21</a>) and most succinctly in the <span class="ital">Shema</span> (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-5">6:4-5</a>). All other laws of God are interpretations and applications of these primary principles.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The life that resulted from obedience to the law was not eternal life in the New Testament sense. It was God’s promise that if the Israelites were faithful to the covenant, the nation could expect long and prosperous days in the land (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.16">5:16</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.5.33">33</a>). Jesus also exhorted his disciples to keep the Ten Commandments and the demands of the <span class="ital">Shema</span> (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37-40">Matt 22:37-40</a>)—not to have eternal life but as an expression of commitment to him (cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.17-19">Matt 5:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.15-21">John 14:15-21</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Central Sanctuary</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God wanted worship to be carried out in the place where he had established his name. For Israel, this place was the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God is <span class="ital">transcendent</span> (above all things) and <span class="ital">omnipresent</span> (present everywhere), yet he chose a specific place for Israel to worship him. Solomon later asked how the God of heaven could be housed in a human structure (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>). The answer is that God’s name stands in his place. The Tabernacle and then the Temple belonged to him and bore his name, so they were, in a sense, his dwelling places. In the ancient Near East, names were more than labels. They represented the character and nature of the named individuals (e.g., Jacob, <a href="?bref=Gen.27.36">Gen 27:36</a>; Jesus, <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Matt 1:21</a>; Barnabas, <a href="?bref=Acts.4.36">Acts 4:36</a>; Peter, <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17-19">Matt 16:17-19</a>). Thus Solomon could advise, “Choose a good reputation [<span class="ital">name</span>] over great riches” (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.1">Prov 22:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God made his home in a sanctuary that bore his name. His glorious presence manifested in fire and cloud during the wilderness wanderings served as a constant reminder that he was at home among his people (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-35">Exod 40:34-35</a>); likewise, upon the completion of the Temple, his presence was evidenced (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God would later come to dwell among his people in the person of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>), thereby eliminating the need for a central sanctuary (see <a href="?bref=John.4.19-24">John 4:19-24</a>). And now, because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, all believers are able to house God’s presence (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19-20">6:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16">2 Cor 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.21">Eph 2:21</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Purge the Evil</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Sin is so abhorrent to God that it cannot coexist with him. The same should be true for his people. God is holy, and he expects his people to reflect his holiness (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.45">Lev 11:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">19:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God required severe measures to remove sin from the covenant community. God offered forgiveness, but only for the truly repentant; those who hardened their hearts could expect God’s judgment—a purging process that devours sinners and their sins and leaves nothing behind (see <a href="?bref=Deut.9.3">Deut 9:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.5">13:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.14">Isa 33:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.28-29">Heb 12:28-29</a>). Such cleansing is meant to heal the community of believers and deter others from rebelling against the Lord (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.13">Deut 17:13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, God’s judgment among his people was often immediate (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.11.1-3">Num 11:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">16:1-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Josh 7</a>). God thus made his people keenly aware of his demand for obedience and of the penalty for those who did not comply.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s retribution is now reserved for the future day of judgment, when the sins of the unrighteous will be exposed and judged (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.10">Rom 14:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.10">2 Cor 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.27">Heb 9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.5">1 Pet 4:5</a>). However, some instances of calamity can be understood as God’s judgment on his disobedient children (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.5.1-11">Acts 5:1-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.27-30">1 Cor 11:27-30</a>).

<p class="theme-title">True Justice</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The community of God’s people in Old Testament Israel was to be responsible for the well-being of widows, orphans, and foreigners (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.19">Deut 27:19</a>). The Israelites were to represent the just God whom they served (see <a href="?bref=Deut.10.17-19">10:17-19</a>) and always remember that they had been an enslaved and defenseless people in Egypt (see <a href="?bref=Deut.10.19">10:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.18-22">24:18-22</a>). How could they, the beneficiaries of God’s unfailing love and faithfulness, ignore the rights and needs of the most vulnerable who lived among them?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Every society has social structures that separate the powerful from the weak and the privileged from the ill-favored. This was true of Old Testament Israel despite its unique constitution and commission as a “holy nation” (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Exod 19:6</a>). Judges and other officials charged with upholding the law might tend to favor individuals with financial means, high social standing, or community influence, especially when these individuals offer bribes (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.19">Deut 16:19</a>). However, God cannot be bribed, nor does he show partiality (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.17">10:17</a>). The rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the exalted and the downtrodden are all alike to him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The prophets of Israel understood the need for equity and justice and often called for the application of these principles to community and national life (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.17">Isa 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.1-4">10:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.14-19">59:14-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.23-29">Ezek 22:23-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-8">Amos 2:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.1.4">Hab 1:4</a>). The New Testament also appeals for proper treatment of the poor and disadvantaged and speaks of God’s displeasure when they are neglected (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Matt 23:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.6-10">2 Cor 9:6-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.1-7">Jas 2:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Justice that falls short of God’s standard is not true justice, and those responsible for corrupting justice can expect full retribution from the Judge of all the earth (see <a href="?bref=Deut.25.13-16">Deut 25:13-16</a>).</p>

<title>Curses and Blessings</title>
<refs>Deut.8.1-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Curses and Blessings</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Nearly all treaty or covenant texts from the ancient Near East contained curses and blessings. The curses were leveled against those who violated the terms of the agreement, while blessings were promised to the faithful. This was particularly true of suzerain-vassal covenants like Deuteronomy (see <a href="?item=Deut_BookIntro_Filament">Deuteronomy Book Introduction</a>, “Literary Form”).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Deuteronomy presented to the assembly of Israel what God expected of the nation. The covenant required the nation of Israel to obey the Lord, and the Israelites had pledged to do so (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.8">Exod 19:8</a>). The section on curses and blessings (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-29">Deut 27:1–29:1</a>) spells out how God would reward their obedience and judge their disobedience. The curses receive more emphasis than the blessings, perhaps because people naturally pay more attention to promises than to warnings. Blessings may also be more easily understood—promised blessings in the future seem to simply provide well-being, whereas judgment is more abstract and needs detailed, graphic description. God emphasizes the curses to drive home the consequences of wrongdoing. The warnings Jesus offered about things to come (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">Matt 24–25</a>) were very much in line with these warnings.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Israel’s subsequent history bears witness to God’s promise of both the blessings and the curses. When Israel was faithful to their covenant with God, he blessed the people. When they rebelled, he brought judgment upon them. Israel’s history of rebellion is succinctly summarized in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.7-20">2 Kings 17:7-20</a>. When the Israelites broke the first two commandments (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.7-10">Deut 5:7-10</a>), they proceeded to violate the whole covenant, and their rebellion brought upon them the curses of <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deuteronomy 28</a>.</p>

<p class="theme-title">God’s Covenant Love</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Often in the Bible, God’s love is understood in the ordinary sense that God has strongly affectionate feelings toward humankind. In certain contexts, however, such as the covenant document of Deuteronomy, love refers to God’s commitment to his people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the ancient Near East, a conquering king would characteristically speak of his relationship to vassal peoples in terms of love, meaning that he had chosen those people to enjoy his favor and to benefit from his protection in exchange for their loyal service. Similarly, God chose Israel to be his servant nation not because the Israelites deserved it but because he loved them (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.6-11">Deut 7:6-11</a>). Put another way, he loved them because he had chosen them. The strongest affirmation of God’s love-choice can be found in <a href="?bref=Mal.1.2-3">Malachi 1:2-3</a>: God chose Jacob but rejected Esau (see also <a href="?bref=Rom.9.13-26">Rom 9:13-26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The special covenantal relationship that God had with Israel was extended to include both Jews and Gentiles through Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-11.18">Acts 10:1–11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-22">Eph 2:11-22</a>).

<title>Holy War</title>
<refs>Deut.7.1-6</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Holy War</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Israelites’ complete annihilation of their enemies poses a major ethical problem. What justification could Israel have had for invading, conquering, and destroying the land of Canaan and its peoples? From a human perspective, it appears that Israel’s aggressive campaigns to settle Canaan were illegal and immoral. Scripture, however, offers a couple of insights that, while not fully eliminating the difficulty in understanding this issue, provide some help.</p>
<p class="theme-body">First, the war against the Canaanites was commanded and led by God himself, not by mere human decision. The holy God was present with Israel in a unique way (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-6">Exod 19:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">40:34-38</a>). After Israel crossed the Jordan, it became clear that God himself was fighting against the Canaanites (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-27">Josh 6</a>); and when he wasn’t, Israel was defeated (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Josh 7</a>). God himself defines what is and is not moral based on his own character. For ancient Israel, that included the notion that in order for the holy God to remain present with his people, the prospect of evil and corruptibility had to be dealt with in a decisive way (see <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-6">Deut 7:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.16-18">Deut 20:16-18</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">Num 25</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-15">Judg 2:1-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Second, the people of Canaan had rebelled against God and had become thoroughly wicked (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.34.1-2">Gen 34:1-2</a>). At the time of Abraham, God declared that the sins of the Canaanites did not yet warrant their destruction (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.16">Gen 15:16</a>). Now, several hundred years later, they did—they were committing horrible crimes against God and their fellow human beings, including idolatry, child sacrifice, adultery, incest, murder, and oppression (see <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lev 18</a>). These sins thoroughly defiled the land and its people (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.24-25">Lev 18:24-25</a>). The holy God was exercising his justice against excessive wickedness.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It is important to recognize that the war that Israel was authorized to wage was thus limited historically and theologically to that specific time and place and people. Medieval campaigns, such as the Crusades by European “Christians” against Middle Eastern “infidels,” or the more recent <span class="ital">jihads</span> of Islamic terrorism cannot be justified based on it. Jesus made it very clear that “God blesses those who work for peace” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.9">Matt 5:9</a>) and that “those who use the sword will die by the sword” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.52">Matt 26:52</a>). Jesus himself, as the Messiah, was expected to lead Israel in military victory over the Romans; instead, he gave up his life sacrificially to defeat the ultimate enemies of sin, death, and Satan. God has reserved for himself the right of judgment (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.19">Rom 12:19</a>), and in the final judgment, he will pour out his holy wrath on human wickedness (see <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-21">Rev 19:11-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-10">20:7-10</a>). Therefore, no one can now rightly claim that God has commanded that a particular group of people should be killed. No justification for genocide exists in the modern world.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Cities of Refuge</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The cities of refuge were built to protect innocent people from blood revenge. An avenger had the legal right to put a murderer to death (<a href="?bref=Num.35.19">Num 35:19</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.9.6">Gen 9:6</a>). If a person caused someone’s death accidentally, the slayer fled to a city of refuge to find temporary safety while awaiting trial (<a href="?bref=Num.35.22-28">Num 35:22-28</a>). The six cities of refuge were distributed across Hebrew territory so that any Israelite could seek asylum.</p>
<p class="theme-body">If, after trial, the fugitive was convicted of murder (instead of involuntary manslaughter), he was turned over to the avenger and received his due punishment (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.12">Deut 19:12</a>). If he was found innocent of murder, the slayer remained in the city of refuge, where he was granted asylum. When the high priest died, the slayer was free to return home and was no longer subject to blood revenge. This merciful legal arrangement protected the land from further pollution by innocent blood (see <a href="?bref=Num.35.33">Num 35:33</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">It was not acceptable to pay a fine to atone for the death of another human being, even if that death was not premeditated (<a href="?bref=Num.35.31-33">Num 35:31-33</a>). Human life was too precious to be ransomed with a simple payment. When a human being was killed, whether deliberately or by accident, it resulted in alienation or exile.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Atonement does not come easily, whether in ancient Israelite times or in our own day; each person is in need of atonement to restore their relationship with God (see <a href="?bref=Rom.3.23-26">Rom 3:23-26</a>). Jesus, the Son of God, provides this reconciliation through his work as the Great High Priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice (see <a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-10.18">Heb 4:14–10:18</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Community Responsibility: Achan’s Sin</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Should an entire community be held responsible for the sins of a smaller few?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Why did so many of Israel’s soldiers die at Ai because of Achan’s sin (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Josh 7</a>)? Why did the Israelites stone Achan’s family along with him? A significant part of the answer to these questions comes by understanding the concept of community responsibility.</p>
<p class="theme-body">If Achan’s family knew of his theft, they were accomplices and shared Achan’s guilt. A community becomes responsible for sin when people either actively participate in an act of sin or silently condone sinful actions or attitudes.</p>
<p class="theme-body">But what about Achan’s children who were too young to understand or those who had no knowledge of his theft? What about Israel’s soldiers who died at Ai because Achan stole what belonged to God?</p>
<p class="theme-body">To understand, we have to go back to the beginning. The sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gen 3</a>), was at least twofold. First, they chose not to trust God, even though they had an intimate relationship with him, choosing instead to listen to the voice of a stranger. Second, though they were unsuccessful, they declared their independence from God by trying to become like gods themselves.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Because we all make that same choice for ourselves, no one is truly innocent (see <a href="?bref=Ps.14.2-3">Ps 14:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.9-23">Rom 3:9-23</a>). As a result, we are all subject to the consequences of sin in the world. We may die as the result of another’s sin, carelessness, or ignorance, or as a result of our own. Because one person drives under the influence of alcohol, someone else might die on the highway. Because one person wants to maximize profits, others can suffer in wretched conditions. And because Achan sinned, others in Israel died at Ai.</p>
<p class="theme-body">None of this is “fair.” However, God promises to bring perfect justice in his own time. God’s justice will be mediated through his grace and mercy, brought to us through Jesus’ death in our place (see <a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Rom 5:12-21</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-body">During the period of the judges, Gideon’s son Abimelech ruled from Shechem (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.1-57">Judg 9</a>). Solomon later fortified Shechem as a provincial capital, but it was sacked soon after, probably by Shishak of Egypt when he invaded Israel in 926 <span class="era">BC</span> (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">1 Kgs 14:25</a>). Jeroboam I then refortified the city and made it the capital of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.25">1 Kgs 12:25</a>). Shechem was again destroyed, this time by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V, in 724 <span class="era">BC</span>, shortly before the destruction of Samaria, and the ruins were virtually uninhabited for about four hundred years.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Inheriting the Land</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Is the material world evil? Are spirit, soul, and energy the pure good toward which we are striving on our earthly journey? Will we only be truly spiritual and truly happy when we are finally free from the prison of this earth-bound flesh?</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Bible answers these and similar questions with an emphatic “No!” The universe, including this earth and all its bodily creatures, came from the skilled and expert hand of the loving Creator and was considered “very good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">Gen 1:31</a>). As a result of our sin, this material world needs redeeming, and by God’s grace, it will have a share in God’s redemption at the end of time (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-21">Rom 8:19-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">One of the ways Scripture affirms the goodness and relevance of this world is by a prominent theology of land. All land belongs to God. God evicted the Canaanite peoples from the Promised Land because of their wickedness. He brought Israel into that land because of his promises to the patriarchs and because he wants the earth to be under human stewards who are attuned to its Maker.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In ancient Israel, this stewardship was facilitated through the allotment of a livable portion of land to each household. Strictly speaking, the allotment of the land, rather than the land itself, was the stewardship trust. The allotment passed down from fathers to sons as the main part of most family inheritances. Following these principles and God’s specific instruction, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, and the tribes divided it among their clans, families, and individual households. God’s gift of stewardship over a specific portion of land was essentially the gift of life to each household.</p>

<title>Oppression of God’s People</title>
<refs>Judg.2.1-3.8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Oppression of God’s People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God does not want his people to be oppressed. From the exodus under Moses to Joshua’s conquest and David’s battles, God’s goal for Israel was complete victory over their enemies (see <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-9">Josh 1:1-9</a>). Similarly, the New Testament consistently speaks of freedom from the oppression of sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-14">Rom 6:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.1-15">Gal 5:1-15</a>) as an inalienable blessing of a relationship with Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Why, then, does oppression exist? The book of Judges suggests that it is because of human disobedience. Israel was promised victory in the conquest if they would obey God, but the reality (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.19-36">Judg 1:19-36</a>) was only partial obedience at best. With the rewards of victory in view, why did God’s people of old—and why does the church today—fall short?</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Judges, the answer was that “another generation” arose that had not participated in the Exodus or the conquest under Joshua, so their faith was increasingly based on stories of divine intervention “in the olden days.” They had not personally “seen all the great things the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had done for Israel” (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.7">2:7</a>). This generation failed to “acknowledge the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel” (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.10">2:10</a>). God had left enemies in the land to test the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>), and Israel failed to drive out these enemies as God had commanded. The rest of the book of Judges illustrates the tragic results of that failure.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God only turns away from his people when they have turned away from him (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.12-14">2:12-14</a>); he never abandons people who truly worship him. Yet grace notes are sounded even in divine retribution as God turned his anger to a beneficial purpose: to teach his people obedience. The very foes who robbed Israel of its divine inheritance and blessing became part of God’s gracious testing. We can learn from oppression, as both physical and spiritual warfare require discipline. The experience can produce a “peaceful harvest of right living” (see <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-11">Heb 12:5-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Through Jesus Christ, God brought undeserved deliverance from the universal oppression of sin, “while we were still sinners” (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.8">Rom 5:8</a>). And just as the Israelites experienced deliverance from their enemies whenever they turned to the Lord, we can be rescued from the ultimate oppressive force when we turn to him in repentance.</p>

<title>Charismatic Leadership</title>
<refs>Judg.2.16-19</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Charismatic Leadership</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Some leaders in Scripture are described as <span class="ital">charismatic</span> (gifted) because their authority did not come from an office or a structure but from the inspiration of God’s Spirit, who gave them particular qualities.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The judges are often included among this group. These charismatic leaders arose in troubled and unsettled times and in response to a crisis. In Judges, these crises were repeatedly precipitated by the fact that “the Israelites did evil in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight” (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12">Judg 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.6.1">6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.10.6">Judg 10:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.13.1">13:1</a>), with enemy oppression as the inevitable result.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The inspired leadership of the judges fits a pattern. The judges were “raised up” by the Spirit and were sustained by prophetic affirmation. What might have led to prophetic utterance in other periods of Israel’s history (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.6">1 Sam 10:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.2">2 Sam 23:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Isa 61:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.5">Ezek 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.8">Mic 3:8</a>), in the times of the judges led to physical prowess (e.g., Samson, <a href="?bref=Judg.14.6">Judg 14:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.14.19">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.14">15:14</a>), skill, or commanding authority (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.10">Judg 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.6.34">6:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.29">11:29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus and the apostles exercised charismatic leadership. As the Jewish authorities were fond of pointing out, Jesus had no “official” authority; yet, he displayed tremendous power and gained a signifcant following. And although the apostles were appointed to what we might consider to be an “office,” there was at that time virtually no structure to back up the office; when they exercised authority, it was purely charismatic. Peter’s healing of the beggar (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-8">Acts 3:1-8</a>) provides a classic contrast between the accoutrements of office, such as “silver and gold,” and true spiritual power.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Charisma has been a powerful tool for effective leadership from the heroes of Israel to the present time. But the successes of charismatic leadership can also be fleeting, particularly when the Spirit, who equips such leaders, is no longer operational in the leader’s life (see <a href="?bref=Judg.16.20-21">Judg 16:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14">1 Sam 16:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.10">Isa 63:10</a>). Those who have been specially gifted by the Spirit to lead must continually be mindful of and dependent on that same Spirit.</p>

<p class="theme-title">God’s Grief over Apostasy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The God of the universe is grieved by his people’s misery (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.16">10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.8-9">Hos 11:8-9</a>). Even when repeatedly spurned, God’s love is more powerful than his wrath, and his compassion exceeds his indignation. That does not mean that his love negates his justice, however, and people will ultimately be judged in the end for their choices and actions (see <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1">2Tim 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.11-15">Rev 20:11-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The entire era of the judges shows what happens in God’s heart when his people repeatedly spurn him. There comes a point, as in the time of Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.5-7">Gen 6:5-7</a>), when God’s patience runs out. For the Israelites who inhabited the land of the judges, that time had come. At one point, after the Israelites had turned to worship other gods and God had allowed them to be oppressed by their enemies, God responded to their plea for help by saying, “Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen! Let them rescue you” (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.14">Judg 10:14</a>). Yet, even then, when Israel repeated its plea for mercy, rid themselves of their idols, and submitted to the Lord’s justice (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.10">10:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.10.15-16">15-16</a>), he provided help.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God longs for people to turn to him in repentance, not wanting anyone to be destroyed (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.9">2 Pet 3:9</a>). And in his justice, he “makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.26">Rom 3:26</a>). He has taken upon himself the grievous weight of our sin (see <a href="?bref=Isa.53.3-12">Isa 53:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19-21">2 Cor 5:19-21</a>) and given us the opportunity to receive his grace.</p>

<title>Social Chaos in Judges</title>
<refs>Judg.2.10-21.25</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Social Chaos in Judges</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">While the book of Judges celebrates divine rescue through heroes, it also chronicles the inadequacy of the status quo. A decline in individual piety throughout the period was accompanied by a rise in social dysfunction, powerfully expressed in chapter <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">5</a> (e.g., <a href="?bref=Judg.5.6-8">5:6-8</a>). Three features of the times stand out: First, the tribes had little ability to function in unison, even when faced by a common enemy (see, e.g., the Gideon and Jephthah stories; chs <a href="?bref=Judg.8.1-35">8</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-15">12</a>). The civil strife within and between tribes reflects covenant disobedience.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Second, the breakdown of civil society is also evidenced throughout the book. Abimelech’s murder of Gideon’s sons, Jephthah’s apparent sacrifice of his daughter, and Samson’s acts of revenge toward the Philistines highlight the depravity and lack of civility that characterized this period.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Third, religious apostasy was widespread in those days. The “evil in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight” committed by the Israelites was repeatedly connected to idolatry (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.11-13">Judg 2:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.7">3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.10.6">10:6</a>). The altar to Baal and the Asherah pole in Gideon’s town of Ophrah (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.25-30">6:25-30</a>) indicate flagrant abandonment of the Lord, as do the worship of the golden ephod made by Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.27">8:27</a>) and the return to worshiping Baal after Gideon’s death (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.33-35">8:33-35</a>). Samson’s intermarriage with the Philistines also directly contradicted the covenant commands (see <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-4">Deut 7:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Social chaos culminates in the closing chapters (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-21.25">Judg 17–21</a>). The incident of Micah, the Levite, and the Danites (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-18.31">17–18</a>) combines religious irregularities with lawless marauding, theft, and violence. The climactic final epilogue (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-21.25">19–21</a>) describes a tragic civil war and the utter abandonment of civility. Marital breakdown, inhospitality, rape, and murder (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-30">19</a>) led to the near elimination of the Benjamites (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.20.1-48">20</a>), who were spared only by the complete decimation of a historic city (Jabesh-gilead) and a sham ceremony in which maidens were seized to become wives (<a href="?bref=Judg.21.6-23">21:6-23</a>). Little wonder that the book concludes, “In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes” (<a href="?bref=Judg.21.25">21:25</a>).</p>

<title>The Family Redeemer</title>
<refs>Ruth.2.20-4.15</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Family Redeemer</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The idea of a family redeemer, established in the law of Moses, finds a vivid example in the story of Ruth. In that book, the expression “family redeemer” has a specific, technical meaning. Elsewhere, the underlying Hebrew term <span class="hebrew">go’el</span> is translated “nearest relative” (<a href="?bref=Num.27.11">Num 27:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.35.19">35:19</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.35.24">24</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">According to the law, family redeemers had three main responsibilities in Israel:</p>
<p class="theme-body">1. <a href="?bref=Lev.25.23-34">Leviticus 25:23-34</a> stipulates that if an Israelite became so poor that he had to sell his land, a family member was to pay off the debt so the land would remain in the family. If no relative could purchase the land and the seller was unable to buy it back, the land still reverted to the seller or his heirs in the Jubilee (fiftieth) Year. Two examples of family redeemers buying land for their relatives are Boaz (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.1-12">Ruth 4:1-12</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-15">Jer 32:6-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">2. Similarly, if an Israelite became so poor he had to sell himself into debt-slavery, a family redeemer was to buy his relative from service to a non-relative (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.35-55">Lev 25:35-55</a>). The poor Israelite would pay off his debt by working for his relative, who could be expected to treat him better than a stranger would.</p>
<p class="theme-body">3. The family redeemer was to pursue justice for an Israelite killed by another’s hand, under conditions described in <a href="?bref=Num.35.9-34">Num 35:9-34</a>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The concept of the family redeemer reminds us that God is the true owner of all things, and he commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lev 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.39-40">Matt 22:39-40</a>). The New Testament presents Jesus as the perfect family redeemer, buying us from the slavery to sin and death into which we had sold ourselves (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Matt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.24-25">Rom 3:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.14">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.9">Rev 5:9</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Exod.6.6">Exod 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.15.13">15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.130.8">Ps 130:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.22">Isa 44:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.20">59:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.9">63:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.11">Jer 31:11</a>).

<title>Vows to God</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Vows to God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The essence of a vow to God is, “If God will do X, then I will dedicate Y” to God or his sanctuary. Examples include Jacob’s tithing (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.20-22">Gen 28:20-22</a>), the Israelites’ dealing with the Canaanite spoils of war (<a href="?bref=Num.21.2">Num 21:2</a>), Hannah’s dedicating her son as a lifelong servant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.11">1 Sam 1:11</a>), and Absalom’s sacrificing to God at Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.8">2 Sam 15:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Guidelines for vows are frequently mentioned in the sacrificial laws. Israelites made vows conditional upon God’s granting their requests. Then they would pay or fulfill their vows to God, often by giving offerings (e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.7.16">Lev 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.23">22:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.11">Deut 12:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">However, vows could be abused. The law itself warns against this (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.21-23">Deut 23:21-23</a>), as do the wisdom teachings (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.7.10-14">Prov 7:10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.25">20:25</a>) and the books of the prophets (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.44.25">Jer 44:25</a>). Saul was prone both to make foolish vows (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.24-28">1 Sam 14:24-28</a>) and to not keep the vows he made (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.6">19:6</a>). Impulsive vows might go unfulfilled and never paid, arousing God’s anger. Not making a vow is better than backing out of one (<a href="?bref=Eccl.5.3-5">Eccl 5:3-5</a>). Jesus counsels us not to make vows, but simply to keep our word (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.33-37">Matt 5:33-37</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Jas.5.12">Jas 5:12</a>).</p>

<title>The Ark of the Covenant</title>
<refs>1Sam.4.1-7.2</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Ark of the Covenant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Ark of the Covenant was a wooden chest overlaid with gold, and it was placed within the Most Holy Place in the sanctuary. The Ark reminded Israel of God’s covenant with them; its contents included the tablets of the covenant (the Ten Commandments). On the Day of Atonement, the high priest would sprinkle blood on the Ark’s cover in order to purify the people (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.2-17">Lev 16:2-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">During Israel’s wilderness wanderings, the glory of God would appear over the Ark, and God would meet with his people there (see <a href="?bref=Exod.25.22">Exod 25:22</a>). Throughout Israel’s history, the Ark served as a sign of God’s presence. It was carried before the people as they traveled (<a href="?bref=Num.10.33-36">Num 10:33-36</a>), and when it was brought to the Jordan River, the water stopped up so the Israelites could pass through on dry ground (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.4-6">Josh 3:4-6</a>). The Ark was carried around Jericho before that city was invaded and was present during the siege of the Ammonite city of Rabbah during David’s time (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-11">2 Sam 11:1-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Philistines equated the Ark with Israel’s God (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.6-8">1 Sam 4:6-8</a>). This is understandable because the Philistines brought images of their own gods into battle (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.21">2 Sam 5:21</a>). The Israelites were not to use images of the divine, so they viewed the Ark as the Lord’s footstool and temporary residence rather than his image (see <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.2">1 Chr 28:2</a>). However, the Israelites developed an idolatrous, pagan point of view. They treated the sacred symbol as a fetish and tried to manipulate God’s presence for their own benefit. They reasoned, “If the Ark is with us, then God’s presence and favor in battle will also be with us” (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.3">1 Sam 4:3</a>). As their defeat that day showed (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-11">4:1-11</a>), God cannot be manipulated—he is the ruler of his people, and he must be obeyed and trusted (cp. <a href="?bref=Josh.5.13-15">Josh 5:13-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Eventually, King David moved the Ark to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-17">2 Sam 6:1-17</a>). When Solomon built the Temple, the Ark was placed in the Most Holy Place, and it continued to play a central role in Israelite worship (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1-11">1 Kgs 8:1-11</a>). After the early monarchical period, the Ark is not mentioned again. Presumably, it was destroyed by the Babylonians along with the Temple in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, though an apocryphal tradition claimed that the prophet Jeremiah had hidden the Ark at the time of the Exile (<a href="?bref=2Macc.2.4-8">2 Macc 2:4-8</a>). Regardless, the arrival of God’s presence through Jesus Christ and the all-sufficient nature of his sacrifice rendered the Ark unnecessary (see <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1-10.18">Heb 9:1–10:18</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Monarchy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">One reason the nation of Israel wanted a king was to be “like all the other nations.” The institution of kingship in other ancient Near Eastern nations was almost two thousand years old by the time of Saul and David, especially in the Egyptian and Babylonian empires. Other much smaller nations—such as Philistia, Moab, and Edom—also had kings with permanent bureaucracies and standing armies. Kings were believed to be the chosen instruments through which deities governed human affairs, so kings reigned either on behalf of the gods or as presumed gods themselves.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Israelites envied other nations and were not interested in the long-term implications of monarchy, in spite of Samuel’s warnings (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.10-18">1 Sam 8:10-18</a>). Several hundred years of monarchy would prove that Samuel’s apprehensions were justified: Wicked kings eventually led God’s chosen nation into foreign domination and exile. Yet God used the monarchy to fulfill his purposes, as he would provide the Messiah through David and his dynasty, establishing an eternal kingdom (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.8-16">2 Sam 7:8-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.1-11">Matt 21:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">Rev 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.15">11:15</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Complete Destruction</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God instructed Saul to “completely destroy” the Amalekites, who had ambushed the Israelites after the Exodus (see <a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">Exod 17:8-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.25.17-19">Deut 25:17-19</a>). The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">kharam</span> (“completely destroy”) often means dedicating something or someone completely to the Lord, either by destroying it (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.3">1 Sam 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.6.17-18">Josh 6:17-18</a>) or by giving it as an offering (see <a href="?bref=Lev.27.28-29">Lev 27:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.6.19">Josh 6:19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Complete destruction was called for in cases where those to be destroyed had committed a severe offense against God, such as worshiping false gods (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-6">Deut 7:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.12-18">13:12-18</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.3">1 Samuel 15:3</a>, complete destruction is prescribed as God’s judgment on a nation that mistreated his chosen people. Those who curse God’s family are, in turn, cursed (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gen 12:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God still judges the godless and impenitent. But in the new covenant, Christians are not called to be agents of such judgment. God calls us to exercise his mercy toward those who wrong us (see <a href="?bref=Luke.9.51-56">Luke 9:51-56</a>). We must completely destroy whatever within ourselves wars against Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.12-13">Rom 8:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.5">Col 3:5</a>).

<refs>1Sam.15.10-35</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Change of Mind</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Thirty-four times in the Old Testament, God is said to “change his mind” or “be sorry” (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">nakham</span>). What could this mean? Did he relent, or did he have pity? Was he sorry, or did he grieve?</p>
<p class="theme-body">One thing is clear: God never repents of sin or moral failure, because he is perfect (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.29">1 Sam 15:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.23.19">Num 23:19</a>). He may “change his mind” regarding calamity or judgment that he initiated—that is, he may decide to stop it—in response to prayers of repentance (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.7-10">Jer 18:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.14">Joel 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.9-10">Jon 3:9-10</a>), a human intercessor (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.11-14">Exod 32:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.2-6">Amos 7:2-6</a>), or with no apparent human mediation (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.18">Judg 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.16">2 Sam 24:16</a>). On a few occasions, God is “sorry” about something he has already done, such as choosing Saul to be king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.11">1 Sam 15:11</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.35">35</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.6.6">Gen 6:6</a>). Yet God is not admitting past mistakes; he is expressing anguish over lives gone awry.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Theologians debate the degree to which God, who is all-wise and all-powerful, can “change his mind.” In the Bible, any language that refers to a change in God’s mind reflects a human perspective on God’s activity. Any change in God, therefore, is a change as humans experience him—a reflection of his unchanging love, mercy, faithfulness, and holy will. It does not suggest a change in God’s power, omniscience, foreknowledge, wisdom, or holiness.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Spirit’s Presence</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord came upon a person or group when they were called to do a task or ordained for an office. The Spirit “came upon” the judges Othniel, Gideon, and Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.10">Judg 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.6.34">6:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.29">11:29</a>), empowering them for service. Saul and David both received the Spirit of God when they were anointed king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">1 Sam 10:1</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.9-10">9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.13">16:13</a>). The Spirit would depart when the task had been completed or when the officeholder was removed from office. When Samuel anointed David as the next king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.13">16:13</a>), the Spirit left Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14">16:14</a>), who was disobedient and had been rejected by God as king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.7-14">13:7-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.10-29">15:10-29</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.15">28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.16.20">Judg 16:20</a>). After David had sinned with Bathsheba, he prayed to be spared this same judgment (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.11">Ps 51:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the New Testament, God’s Holy Spirit is given to all who put their faith in Christ for salvation, not just to individuals in specific roles (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.14-21">Acts 2:14-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-13">1 Cor 12:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13-14">Eph 1:13-14</a>). Still, the Spirit performs a similar role in equipping God’s servants to do the work that God has called them to do (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.7-10">1 Cor 12:7-10</a>). The Old Testament departure of the Spirit from Saul tangibly demonstrates the need for the New Testament warnings not to sin against the Spirit and not to bring sorrow to the Spirit (see <a href="?bref=Mark.3.28-29">Mark 3:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.30">Eph 4:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.1-8">Heb 6:1-8</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Calling up the Dead</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Old Testament forbids occult practices, such as spiritism, divination, and necromancy, in which someone attempts to contact the dead, usually to seek guidance about the future (see <a href="?bref=Deut.18.9-12">Deut 18:9-12</a>). Practicing necromancy and consulting a necromancer were capital offenses (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.6">Lev 20:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.20.27">27</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.9">1 Sam 28:9</a>). God’s people were instead to rely on God for divine guidance.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God buried Moses in an unmarked grave (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.6">Deut 34:6</a>), possibly because he did not want the Israelites to make Moses’ grave a shrine, present offerings to his spirit, worship him, or attempt to consult his spirit. They may have been prone to these sorts of practices because of their time in Egypt and because of Moses’ stature and his role in mediating Israel’s covenant with God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Old Testament makes it plain that the dead cannot be contacted (cp. <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.23">2 Sam 12:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.14.10-12">Job 14:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.10">Pss 88:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.17">115:17</a>). Samuel is the only known exception; God apparently commanded him to return and speak (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.12-19">1 Sam 28:12-19</a>). Saul’s sin in consulting a medium was so severe that the Chronicler singles out this failure in commenting on Saul’s downfall (see <a href="?bref=1Chr.10.13-14">1 Chr 10:13-14</a>). There is never any justification for seeking advice from the dead when we have the living word of God to guide us (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.15-17">2 Tim 3:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.12-13">Heb 4:12-13</a>).</p>

<title>Canaanite Religion</title>
<refs>1Sam.5.1-12</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Canaanite Religion</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Canaanites explained nature by reference to their gods. Each god represented some force of nature. The moon, sun, important stars, and visible planets each were considered a god or goddess. Canaanite deities had two striking features: an extraordinary fluidity of personality, and names whose meanings were related to their function. A few of these gods were particularly influential in the interaction of the Israelites with the Canaanite peoples:</p>
<p class="theme-list-sp"><span class="bold">El:</span> “the powerful one,” the head of the Canaanite pantheon. El was distant, living far away from Canaan “at the source of the two rivers” (a lingering memory of Eden, perhaps). He presided over a divine council of gods who were his children. In the Old Testament, <span class="ital">El</span> (pl. <span class="ital">Elohim</span>) is used to speak of God, though the Lord is not identical with the Canaanite deity.</p>
<p class="theme-list"><span class="bold">Baal:</span> “lord,” the great storm god and king of the gods. Baal acted as El’s prime minister and was functionally far more important than El. He was the giver of all fertility. When he died, all vegetation and procreation temporarily ceased. He was the god of justice, the terror of evildoers.</p>
<p class="theme-list"><span class="bold">Dagon:</span> “fish” or “grain,” sometimes referred to as the father of Baal. Dagon was the chief god of the Philistine city of Ashdod (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-7">1 Sam 5:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list"><span class="bold">Ashtoreth, Anath, Asherah:</span> the three main goddesses of the Canaanite pantheon, concerned mainly with sex and war. Their primary function was to have sexual relations with Baal on a continual yearly cycle, maintaining Baal’s virility and thus the fertility of the earth.</p>
<p class="theme-body-sp">The Canaanites’ personification of the forces of nature accounted for the succession of the seasons. The dry period from April to the end of October represented the duration of Baal’s death after an unsuccessful battle each spring. Commencement of the autumn rains signaled Baal’s revival as the rain and vegetation god, continuing until the following April. The Canaanites believed that the land regained its fertility because of the annual mating of Baal and his female consort, and their own religious activities included imitation of their gods’ behavior.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Canaanites thus worshiped things they felt would benefit them materially. If the gods and goddesses were pleased by the worship, the result would be a plentiful harvest. If a god became angry, animal or human sacrifice might appease the god (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.26-27">2 Kgs 3:26-27</a>). Canaanite worship was therefore fundamentally based on fear and manipulation.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Contact among the many religions of the ancient Near East produced not only social tension but also religious borrowing. The Arameans and Philistines who settled in Canaan adopted the practices of the Canaanites; the Amorites similarly incorporated Sumerian religion when they moved into Mesopotamia.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Israel’s God, Yahweh, by contrast, demanded exclusive allegiance, and he insisted on worship based on faith rather than manipulative fear. Unfortunately, the Israelites failed to maintain their exclusive monotheism. They adopted pagan thinking and practices, worshiping the Canaanite gods in the Canaanite way, leading to the corruption of their culture and rousing God’s anger. As a result, God brought judgment upon his people, sending them into exile (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.18-25.21">24:18–25:21</a>).</p>

<title>Hostile Authority: David’s Response</title>
<refs>1Sam.18.6-24.22</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Hostile Authority: David’s Response</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As David became successful, King Saul became his enemy. The Lord had left Saul as a result of the king’s unfaithfulness, and the anointing of the Spirit now rested on David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.1-16.14">1 Sam 15:1–16:14</a>). When Saul needed someone to soothe his mind, he found that David’s harp playing was music to his soul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.15-23">16:15-23</a>). When Saul needed someone to deal with the ominous threat of Goliath, he found in David a capable and successful young warrior (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Sam 17</a>). But as others began noticing David and praising his success, Saul became frightened and jealous (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.6-9">18:6-9</a>), and his jealousy soon developed into anger, rage, and murderous hatred.</p>
<p class="theme-body">After Saul tried to kill David with a spear on two occasions (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.10-11">18:10-11</a>), David continued serving him: He led a contingent of the king’s troops (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.13">18:13</a>), married the king’s daughter (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.17-27">18:17-27</a>), and served in Saul’s court as a harpist (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.7">19:7</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.9">9</a>). But David’s continuing success was too much for the paranoid Saul, who again tried to murder him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.9-11">19:9-11</a>). David had no choice but to escape (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.11-18">19:11-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.20.1-42">20:1-42</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">For the rest of Saul’s reign, David was a fugitive, hunted by the king he had faithfully served. Even then, he refused to harm Saul. On two occasions, David had the opportunity to assassinate Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.24.1-22">1 Sam 24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1-25">26</a>), but he refused to “attack the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s anointed one” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.24.6">24:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.9">26:9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">During these years as a fugitive, David continued to serve the Lord and the people of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-6">23:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.4-9">25:4-9</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.14-16">14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.27.8-9">27:8-9</a>). When news reached David that Saul and Jonathan had been killed, he deeply mourned the death of a “beloved and gracious” king and his son (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.17-27">2 Sam 1:17-27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">David was persistently faithful to a king who hated him and wanted him dead. Similarly, Jeremiah prophesied in the court of kings who burned his words in the fireplace and put him in a cistern to die (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.21-26">Jer 36:21-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.38.1-13">38:1-13</a>). And Daniel and his friends faithfully served in the court of Babylonian and Persian kings, even when the kings’ decisions were hostile to their faith or to them personally (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">Dan 3</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.6.1-28">6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Faithfulness under an enemy in authority doesn’t always bring success. The ultimate example of this is Jesus himself: He was hounded by authorities who eventually succeeded in having him executed. Jesus never “succeeded” in life, but he continued to trust his Father in heaven. Success for Jesus lay beyond death in the Resurrection. It may be the same for some of us: We may die under authorities who hate us without seeing any good come of our suffering. In the age to come, God will right every wrong and will reward the faithfulness of those who suffered under hostile authority.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Celebration</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God welcomes exuberant expressions of joy and delight from those who worship and praise him (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.29">Isa 30:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.30.19">Jer 30:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.13">31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.17">Zeph 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.19">Eph 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.16">Col 3:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">David’s two attempts to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-11">2 Sam 6:1-11</a>, <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.12-23">12-23</a>) were marked by celebration. Three Hebrew terms for “danced/dancing” are found in the account of the second procession of the Ark (see also <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.25-29">1 Chr 15:25-29</a>): <span class="hebrew">karar</span> (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.14">2 Sam 6:14</a>, <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.16">16</a>), <span class="hebrew">pazaz</span> (NLT, “leaping,” <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.16">6:16</a>), and <span class="hebrew">raqad</span> (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.29">1 Chr 15:29</a>, “skipping about”). All three words refer to vigorous physical expression beyond the meaning of the Hebrew term for “celebrate” used in David’s first attempt (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sam 6:5</a>). Thus, in the first procession, David celebrated; in the second procession he engaged in exultant dancing and extravagant merrymaking with intensified musical expression through the addition of shouting and trumpets.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Musical instruments played a significant role in Temple worship. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1-31">1 Chronicles 25:1-31</a>, David assigned various groups to the ministry of music. Many psalms refer to playing musical instruments in praise and worship of God (see <a href="?bref=Ps.33.2-3">Pss 33:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.8">57:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.81.2">81:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.92.1-3">92:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.98.4-6">98:4-6</a>). In <a href="?bref=Ps.149.1-9">Pss 149</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1-6">150</a>, dance and music are combined as a praise offering. Similarly, music and dancing were heard in the father’s house in the parable of the lost son (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.25">Luke 15:25</a>), as the son’s return was truly a joyful occasion.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Revelation gives a picture of the eternal celebration that awaits the faithful—a celebration characterized by worship in the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">Rev 4:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.8-14">5:8-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.15.1-4">15:1-4</a>). This celebration is described as a wedding feast, in which the bridegroom (Christ) and the bride (his church) are joined together forever (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.9">Rev 19:9</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Matt 22:1-14</a>).</p>

<title>God’s Covenant with David</title>
<refs>2Sam.7.4-17</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Covenant with David</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God made covenants with his people five times in the Old Testament: (1) when he promised Noah that humanity would never again be destroyed by a flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.18">Gen 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.9.1-17">9:1-17</a>); (2) when he promised Abraham that he would inherit the land of Canaan and establish a great nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Gen 15:1-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">17:1-27</a>); (3) when he formed a unique relationship with Israel at Mount Sinai through Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-23.33">Exod 19–23</a>); (4) when he promised a priestly dynasty to Phinehas (<a href="?bref=Num.25.10-13">Num 25:10-13</a>); and (5) when he promised a royal dynasty to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.4-17">2 Sam 7:4-17</a>). In addition, God promised through Jeremiah to make a “new covenant” in the future (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s promise to David is not explicitly identified as a covenant in <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Samuel 7</a>. However, other passages do identify the event as a covenant (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.5">23:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.18">2 Chr 7:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.7">21:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.3-4">Pss 89:3-4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.89.28-29">28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.11-12">132:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.3">Isa 55:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.20-21">Jer 33:20-21</a>). God’s promise to David that his “favor will not be taken from him” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.15">2 Sam 7:15</a>) speaks of a covenant relationship. Like God’s promise to Abraham, his covenant with David is unconditional: It does not depend on human obedience or faithfulness but only on God’s unchanging love.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At the heart of this covenant is God’s promise to raise up David’s successors forever and to be a father to them (cp. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.36">1 Kgs 11:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.4">15:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.19">2 Kgs 8:19</a>). God’s blessing on Solomon’s reign is a partial fulfillment of this promise (cp. <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.10-11">2 Sam 7:10-11</a> with <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.56">1 Kgs 8:56</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.20">1 Kgs 8:20</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.24">24</a>). God’s patience with the kings of Judah even when they turned away from him was the result of his covenant promise to David (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.12-13">1 Kgs 11:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The complete and final fulfillment of God’s covenant with David is found in the Messiah, Jesus Christ, the “son of David” (e.g., see <a href="?bref=Matt.9.27">Matt 9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.30-31">20:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.9">21:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.21.15">15</a>). Isaiah foretold of one who would rule “from the throne of his ancestor David for all eternity” (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">Isa 9:7</a>) and called him the “shoot” growing “out of the stump of David’s family” (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Isa 11:1</a>). Both of these references point to the coming Messiah. Four passages in the New Testament teach that Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of the promises made to David by referring directly to <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sam 7:1-29</a> (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32-33">Luke 1:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.29-31">Acts 2:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.22-23">13:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.5">Heb 1:5</a>). The New Testament opens (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Matt 1:1</a>) and closes (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.16">Rev 22:16</a>) with reference to Jesus as the son of David, the successor to his throne.</p>

<p class="theme-body">There is a notable difference between the accounts of David’s census in Samuel and in Chronicles. <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1">Second Samuel 24:1</a> attributes the census taking to God (“the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> . . . caused David to harm them by taking a census”), while <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1">1 Chronicles 21:1</a> attributes the action to Satan (“Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel”).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-25">Second Samuel 24:1-25</a> tells the census story from God’s perspective as the primary agent; God permitted Satan’s action in order to fulfill his own purpose.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This phenomenon is not uncommon in Scripture. <a href="?bref=Matt.4.1">Matthew 4:1</a> contains a similar instance of dual agency, where Jesus is led out into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by the devil. Perhaps the most notable similar experience is Job’s trial: It was brought on by Satan and permitted by God—after the Lord had spoken glowingly about Job (<a href="?bref=Job.1.6-2.7">Job 1:6–2:7</a>). Through all the trials that followed, Job’s heart was righteous despite Satan’s attempts to elicit a curse against God. Similarly, <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.7">2 Corinthians 12:7</a> teaches that a God-sent affliction can be delivered by a messenger from Satan. When Paul wrote that he was given a “thorn,” he used a passive verb, indicating that this affliction was given by God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Satan works in many ways in an attempt to discourage or destroy God’s people. Yet God is sovereign. God does not author evil, but sometimes God makes use of others’ evil deeds to accomplish his good purposes (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.20">Gen 50:20</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Jerusalem</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jerusalem was a functioning city as early as four hundred years before the time of David. It was never fully captured during the conquest and the period of the judges (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.63">Josh 15:63</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.8">Judg 1:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.1.21">21</a>), and peaceful relations were evidently established between the autonomous Jebusite enclave and the surrounding Israelites (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.10-12">Judg 19:10-12</a>). So impregnable was Jerusalem that the Old Testament records only three successful invaders: David, Jehoash (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.11-14">2 Kgs 14:11-14</a>), and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-10">2 Kgs 25:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Whatever David’s method of capturing Jerusalem (his use of a water tunnel is debatable—see <a href="?item=IISam.5.8_StudyNote_Filament">study note on 5:8</a>), he secured Jerusalem as the political, and eventually spiritual, capital of Israel. <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-14">Psalm 48</a> speaks beautifully and powerfully of Jerusalem as a fortress. Its towers, bulwarks, and easily defensible citadels with their rugged terrain could produce a false sense of security, if not idolatry. <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-3">Psalm 48:1-3</a> reminds the reader that God’s living presence, not the topography of the city, made Jerusalem safe.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Both the Old Testament and the New Testament call Jerusalem a “holy city” (see <a href="?bref=Neh.11.1">Neh 11:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.11.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.1">Isa 52:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.24">Dan 9:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.4.5">Matt 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.53">27:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">Rev 21:2</a>). It is the only city so described in the Bible. Wherein lies this city’s holiness? It cannot be a reflection of the holiness of its occupants. In fact, so unholy was the populace that the city was decimated by the Babylonians in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nor was it a holy city because it was Israel’s capital for several centuries. Jerusalem was a holy city, first of all, because God chose it (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.44">1 Kgs 8:44</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.48">48</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.13">11:13</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.32">32</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.36">36</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.5">2 Chr 6:5</a>, <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.34">34</a>). And because he chose it, he put his glory and his name there (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.21">1 Kgs 14:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.13">2 Chr 12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1-10.22">Ezek 8–10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-27">43:1-27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Gospels and Acts, Jerusalem was still a city of great importance. Herod the Great (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>) had expanded the city and conducted extensive building projects—including the Temple. It remained the center of Israel’s spiritual life (see e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-26">3:1-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.12">5:12</a>), and many events in the lives of Jesus and his followers occurred in Jerusalem. Jesus had some harsh words for Jerusalem (see <a href="?bref=Matt.23.37-39">Matt 23:37-39</a>)—especially its leadership—and he was eventually put to death there. Jesus warned of impending judgment on the city (see <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-2">Mark 13:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.20-24">Luke 21:20-24</a>), and his words were actualized in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p class="theme-body">But the New Testament also introduces the new Jerusalem, the heavenly city comprised of God’s holy people (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.10">Heb 11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">Rev 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">21:2</a>). As the earthly Jerusalem was the sphere in which the glorious presence and reign of God was partially actualized through King David and his successors, the new Jerusalem represents the government of Jesus Christ, the son of David, and his everlasting presence with his people (cp. <a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.3">Rev 21:3</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Covenant with Israel’s Kings</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Solomon understood his role as David’s successor (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.7">1 Kgs 3:7</a>). The aged King David had admonished his son Solomon to keep all of God’s requirements in the law of Moses in order to “be successful in all you do and wherever you go” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.3">2:3</a>). Solomon’s faithfulness would allow the fulfillment of God’s promises to David (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.4">1 Kgs 2:4</a>; see <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.5-16">2 Sam 7:5-16</a>). Early in his reign, he consciously emulated his father’s love for and faithfulness to God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.3">1 Kgs 3:3</a>), and he recognized that God had kept his promises to David (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.23-26">8:23-26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Several times during Solomon’s reign, God himself communicated the inviolability of his covenant with David (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.14">3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.4-5">9:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.38">11:38</a>). God ultimately judged Solomon and subsequent kings by their faithfulness to that covenant in comparison to David (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.12-13">11:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.8">14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.11">11</a>). God’s commendation and blessing or disapproval and judgment were consistently based on whether people kept or violated his law (see <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deut 28</a>). During the days of the kings, the people of Israel were condemned for willfully turning away from the clear precepts of the Lord contained in the law and spoken through God’s prophets (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.13-17">2 Kgs 17:13-17</a>). Their rejection of God resulted in judgment (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.18-23">2 Kgs 17:18-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.11-15">21:11-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s dealings with the kings of Israel provide an example for those who are now in covenant with God through Christ. God’s people today are to love the Lord, keep his commandments (<a href="?bref=John.14.21">John 14:21</a>), and be faithful to him in all things (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.21">Matt 25:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.10-12">Luke 16:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.14">2 Tim 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.7">4:7</a>). Those who follow David’s example of faithfulness will similarly receive God’s praise (see <a href="?bref=Acts.13.22">Acts 13:22</a>). Those who confess the name of Jesus, David’s heir (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.32-37">Acts 13:32-37</a>), and who have a heart of devotion to God and his word will seek to live lives that are pure and pleasing to God (see <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20-21">Heb 13:20-21</a>). They look forward to an abundant, eternal inheritance (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.8">2 Tim 4:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">Rev 2:10</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-21">Gal 5:19-21</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Solomon’s Wisdom</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When God gave Solomon the opportunity to ask for anything he wanted, Solomon chose wisdom, so that he could “govern [God’s] people well and know the difference between right and wrong” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.9">1 Kgs 3:9</a>). In response to this unselfish choice, God granted the wisdom he desired (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.12">3:12</a>) and the rewards of its proper use (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.13-14">3:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.1.14-17">2 Chr 1:14-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Solomon’s subsequent behavior provided immediate evidence of his wisdom. He resolved an argument over a child with such insight that the people were “in awe of the king” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.16-28">1 Kgs 3:16-28</a>). Later, the queen of Sheba came to test him with difficult questions and found his wisdom exceeding all that she had heard about it (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-9">10:1-9</a>). His administration (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.1-28">4:1-28</a>), his diplomacy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-9">5:1-9</a>), his building projects (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.10-7.51">5:10–7:51</a>), and his commerce (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">9:26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.14-29">10:14-29</a>) all demonstrated his wisdom. Solomon accumulated vast knowledge (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.29-33">4:29-33</a>) and wrote proverbs (much of the book of Proverbs), songs (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-20">Pss 72</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.127.1-5">127</a>), love poetry (the Song of Songs), and philosophical literature (Ecclesiastes). He used his wisdom to build the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.12">2 Chr 2:12</a>), even as Bezalel had previously been endowed with wisdom to build the Tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.1-3">Exod 31:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus noted Solomon’s great wisdom and reminded his hearers that someone even greater than Solomon was among them (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.42">Matt 12:42</a>). Jesus is the true wisdom of God in whom one can find ultimate wisdom (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.24">1 Cor 1:24</a>).

<p class="theme-title">Pure Worship</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">From the beginning of God’s relationship with Israel, he made provision for their worship of him to be pleasing to him (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-40.38">Exod 20–40</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-8.36">Lev 1–8</a>). One of the Lord’s key purposes for his people is that they offer him pure worship.</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Solomon built the Temple as a permanent worship sanctuary, he took great care to erect “a Temple to honor the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.3-5">1 Kgs 5:3-5</a>). He built in accordance with the pattern he was given, placing the Ark in the inner sanctuary in the proper manner and dedicating the Temple to the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1-11">8:1-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=Deut.16.13-17">Deut 16:13-17</a>). In all of this, Solomon kept the requirements laid down in the law (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.25.10-22">Exod 25:10-22</a>), which were intended to keep Israel’s worship purely focused on the Lord and his word.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Unfortunately, people tend to worship according to their own inclinations rather than according to God’s instructions, and Israel was no different. In his later years, Solomon turned away from the Lord to other gods (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.4-8">1 Kgs 11:4-8</a>). After Solomon’s death, Jeroboam established a competing, idolatrous religion in the northern kingdom, in clear violation of God’s law (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.9-10">14:9-10</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.15-16">15-16</a>). False worship characterized the northern kingdom throughout its history (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.13">16:13</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.25-26">25-26</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">30-33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.25-26">21:25-26</a>). Meanwhile, in Judah, the southern kingdom, tolerance for local pagan altars became a persistent spiritual distraction (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.14">15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.43">22:43</a>). Neither Judah nor Israel remained pure in their worship of the Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">There is one God, and God’s people must worship only him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.23">1 Kgs 8:23</a>; see <a href="?bref=Deut.5.7">Deut 5:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.5.9">9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.6">John 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.12">Acts 4:12</a>).

Just as Israel’s Temple was a sanctuary intended to attract all people (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.41-43">1 Kgs 8:41-43</a>), believers, who are the temple of the living God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>), are to live so as to attract and motivate others to desire to know the Lord and worship him (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.16">Matt 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.40-47">Acts 2:40-47</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.5">2 Tim 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12">1 Pet 2:12</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Land</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Land is extremely important to a largely agrarian society such as ancient Israel. Israel was given the privilege and responsibility of living in the land of Canaan, as a key provision of God’s covenant with them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.33-40">1 Kgs 8:33-40</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deut 28</a>). The land was part of Israel’s relationship with God: God had promised this land to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gen 12:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.13.14-17">13:14-17</a>). The nation of Israel lived in the land as its custodians and earthly possessors. The land was Israel’s “special possession” (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.21">Deut 4:21</a>), given by God, who required their fidelity (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.40">Deut 4:40</a>). God expected the people to be proper stewards of the land and to serve him faithfully.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Unfortunately, God’s people turned to their own ways, serving pagan gods and themselves (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.7-17">2 Kgs 17:7-17</a>). So God allowed foreign nations to gradually take away Israel’s ownership of the land (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">2 Kgs 8:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.3">17:3</a>). Eventually, Assyria launched a full-scale invasion of the northern kingdom, sending the Israelites into exile (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-6">17:5-6</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.22-23">22-23</a>). Through these events God warned the people of Judah, the southern kingdom, that if they, too, failed to respond, they would forfeit their land (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.8">2 Kgs 21:8</a>). Sadly, they refused to listen (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.9">2 Kgs 21:9</a>), and their unfaithfulness eventually resulted in expulsion from the land at the hands of the Babylonians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-7">25:1-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Israel’s rebellion and failure to properly manage the land that God entrusted to them serves as a warning to us. God has redeemed us in Christ Jesus so that we may live faithful and productive lives (<a href="?bref=John.15.16">John 15:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4-10">Eph 2:4-10</a>). Our infidelity and lack of productivity may cause us to lose our place of service for Christ (<a href="?bref=John.15.1-2">John 15:1-2</a>, <a href="?bref=John.15.6">6</a>). It is by abiding in him that we “produce much fruit” and grow in our faith (<a href="?bref=John.15.5">John 15:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s people always have a propensity to sin (see <a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">Rom 3:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.8">1 Jn 1:8</a>, <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.10">10</a>). Nevertheless, God always stands ready to forgive and restore those who turn back to him (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.9">1 Jn 1:9</a>) and to reinstate the blessings of his covenant. The one who mediates the new covenant between God and his people (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.27-28">Matt 26:27-28</a>) is also their advocate in heaven (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 Jn 2:1</a>). In the end, those who remain faithful to God will inherit the blessings of the new heaven and the new earth (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3-5">1 Pet 1:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-7">Rev 21:1-7</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Faithfulness to His People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When God established the covenant with his people Israel, it included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (see <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deut 28:1-68</a>). Many years later, when Solomon had finished dedicating the Temple, the Lord appeared to him and reminded him that if the people were unfaithful to this covenant, sure judgment would follow (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.6-9">1 Kgs 9:6-9</a>). Conversely, if they were faithful, God would dwell among them and never forsake them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.12-13">6:12-13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God had called the nation Israel to be his covenant people (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-6">Exod 19:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.53">1 Kgs 8:53</a>). Despite this unique identity, the people of Israel were frequently rebellious toward God (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-6">Exod 32:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.1-12">Num 14:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.10-15">Judg 2:10-15</a>). Even during the height of God’s blessing of Israel (Solomon’s reign) the people “sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.2">3:2</a>), an expression of their ongoing commitment to pagan worship (see also <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.4-13">1 Kgs 11:4-13</a>). Both the northern and southern kingdoms later fell into this sin (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.31-32">12:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.2">13:2</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.32-33">32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.22-24">14:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.14">15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.43">22:43</a>). Every ruler of the northern kingdom led the people into apostate religious practices, resulting in Israel being sent into exile in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. While the southern kingdom experienced occasional religious reform, such reform would only be temporary, and Judah would ultimately suffer a similar fate in being exiled by the Babylonians in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. Still, God retained a faithful remnant among his people (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.18">1 Kgs 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.20-34">Isa 10:20-34</a>) and had plans for their future well-being (see <a href="?bref=Isa.4.2-6">Isa 4:2-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-11">Isa 40:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.1-24">Jer 30:1-24</a>). In spite of his people’s unfaithfulness, God maintained his love and faithfulness toward them and desired to restore them (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.1-23">Hos 2:1-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God still has a people who are his own (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pet 1:1</a>). Those who follow Christ are his “chosen people” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9-10">1 Pet 2:9-10</a>, who constitute the temple of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-7.1">2 Cor 6:14–7:1</a>). They have God’s promise that he will never forsake them but will always be faithful to his promises to them (<a href="?bref=John.14.16">John 14:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.13">2 Tim 2:13</a>).</p>

<title>True Success</title>
<refs>1Kgs.13.33-34</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">True Success</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God requires complete devotion from his people (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-6">Deut 6:4-6</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Matt 22:37</a>). True success comes from seeking God and acknowledging him as sovereign (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">Matt 6:33</a>), to the exclusion of all idols (<a href="?bref=1Jn.5.21">1 Jn 5:21</a>). For the people of Israel, success was directly tied to their obedience to God’s covenant (see <a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">Lev 26:1-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deut 28:1-68</a>). The spiritual condition of Israel and its leaders had a dramatic impact on whether or not they would continue to receive God’s favor and maintain possession of the Promised Land.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The author of 1–2 Kings introduces each ruler’s reign with a spiritual evaluation, often comparing each king’s devotion to God with the precedent set by David (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.38">1 Kgs 11:38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.8">14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.11">11</a>). The narrative of these books demonstrates that the fate of both Israel and Judah hangs on the spiritual leadership of their kings. The continued success of God’s people in the land of Canaan was predicated on the faithful worship of God (see <a href="?bref=Deut.12.4-7">Deut 12:4-7</a>). Allowing worship at local pagan shrines is repeatedly singled out for disapproval (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.2-4">3:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.7">11:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Beginning with Jeroboam I, the kings of Israel (the northern kingdom) uniformly practiced apostate religion and were censured for practicing it (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.31-32">12:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.33-34">13:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.25-26">15:25-26</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.33-34">33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.11-13">16:11-13</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.25-26">25-26</a>). Of these kings, King Ahab was the most wicked (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">16:30-33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.25-26">21:25-26</a>), and his son Ahaziah closely followed his example and is denounced for his idolatrous ways (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.51-53">22:51-53</a>). The kings of the northern kingdom set their people on a course doomed for destruction (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.21-23">2 Kgs 17:21-23</a>). Despite God’s repeated efforts to get his people’s attention (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.13-15">2 Kgs 17:13-15</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.23">23</a>), they failed to respond, so God invoked the penalties for persistent spiritual infidelity (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.33-34">1 Kgs 13:33-34</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Some of the kings of Judah (the southern kingdom) receive commendation, but many of them are denounced as well. Rehoboam allowed pagan worship to spread in Judah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.22-24">14:22-24</a>), and Abijam continued in his father’s sins (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3">15:3</a>). Even the good kings Asa and Jehoshaphat receive criticism for letting popular local worship sites continue (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.14">15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.43">22:43</a>). Failure to give God his rightful place had disastrous results.</p>
<p class="theme-body">While the kings and people of the northern kingdom foolishly pursued their own way, people who instead fear the Lord and live by the standards of God’s word will be blessed and find genuine contentment (<a href="?bref=Ps.33.12">Pss 33:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.1-2">119:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.15">144:15</a>). True success is always found in acknowledging and trusting God to be king of one’s life (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">Matt 6:33</a>). And as both Jesus and his early followers demonstrate, success is not necessarily characterized by material blessing and wealth. Joy and peace are ultimately found in being at the center of God’s will and in grasping the hope we have in him (see <a href="?bref=Phil.3.8-14">Phil 3:8-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">1 Pet 4:12-19</a>).</p>

<refs>1Kgs.17.1-19.21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Prophets in 1 Kings</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God’s prophets played a major role in the Old Testament kingdoms of Israel and Judah. They ministered to people’s everyday needs, confronted kings and priests over their apostasy, and performed many miracles. They brought announcements of God’s coming plans (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-32">1 Kgs 11:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">17:1</a>), especially messages of judgment (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-2">13:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.42">20:42</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.20-23">21:20-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.20-22">22:20-22</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Several examples from 1 Kings serve to illustrate the prophets’ role. The faithful prophet Nathan, who had rebuked David regarding his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.1-12">2 Sam 12:1-12</a>), played a crucial role in counteracting Adonijah’s attempt to seize his father David’s throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-49">1 Kgs 1:5-49</a>). The prophet Ahijah informed Jeroboam that God intended to divide Solomon’s kingdom after his death (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-39">11:29-39</a>). Later, God used an unnamed prophet to condemn Jeroboam’s apostate religion and the altar at Bethel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-10">13:1-10</a>) and to demonstrate the consequences of disobeying the Lord’s commission (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.11-32">13:11-32</a>). Ahijah reappeared, announcing the Lord’s judgment against Jeroboam and his heirs (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.1-16">14:1-16</a>). The prophet Jehu announced judgment on King Baasha for continuing in Jeroboam’s sin (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>). Finally, a large portion of 1 Kings is devoted to the prophet Elijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-19.21">17:1–19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.17-28">21:17-28</a>), who was God’s primary spokesman during King Ahab’s reign (though other prophets were also active during this period; see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.38-43">20:38-43</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.17-28">22:17-28</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The prophets in 1 Kings received varied reception from the kings of Israel and Judah. The wisdom of listening to God’s prophets is highlighted throughout the narrative, as is the danger of rejecting the prophets and their message. Through his spokesmen, the prophets, God sought to prevent the catastrophes that were forthcoming based on the disobedience of the people. Unfortunately, many of the kings failed to listen to and heed the prophets, thereby bringing about the devastation that had been forewarned.</p>

<p class="theme-body-fl">Choosing sin rather than faithfulness to the only true God invites disaster. This has been true since the very beginning, when Adam and Eve’s disobedience brought curses and banishment from their initial home (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gen 3</a>). And it was true throughout Israel’s history (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">Num 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Josh 7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-12.19">2 Sam 11:1–12:19</a>). The New Testament offers numerous warnings about the eternal consequences of unrepented sinful behavior (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-10">1 Cor 6:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-21">Gal 5:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.15">Rev 22:15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The sinful acts of God’s people are prominent throughout the late monarchical period. Words such as <span class="ital">sin</span>, <span class="ital">evil</span>, and <span class="ital">wicked</span> appear frequently to assert that the kings of both Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.2">2 Kgs 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.2">13:2</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.11">11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.24">14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.9">15:9</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.18">18</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.24">24</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.28">28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.2">17:2</a>) and Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.18">8:18</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.27">27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.2">21:2</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.16">16</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.32">23:32</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.37">37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.9">24:9</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.19">19</a>) did “what was evil in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">The northern kingdom was particularly culpable. Its kings and people were uniformly condemned for their godless ways (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.16-17">17:16-17</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.22">22</a>); the basic sin of apostate worship, introduced by Jeroboam I, continued in Israel until the end (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.29">10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.21-23">17:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.15">23:15</a>). God repeatedly warned the people through his prophets (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.13">17:13</a>) and brought the chastisement of foreign invaders (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.3">13:3</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.7">7</a>). Nothing moved the Israelites’ hearts, for they were set in their ways (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.6">13:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.14-17">17:14-17</a>). Eventually God allowed foreign invaders to defeat them and occupy their land, sending many into exile (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.18">17:18</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.20-23">20-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The people of Judah were not innocent either. Many of their kings were guilty of gross wickedness, and Judean society grew increasingly apostate and followed “the evil practices that Israel had introduced” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.19">17:19</a>). Despite God’s repeated acts of kindness (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.32-36">19:32-36</a>) and warnings delivered through his prophets (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.8-15">21:8-15</a>), the people persisted in their sin, and God’s judgment once again fell (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.10-15">21:10-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26-27">23:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-4">24:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-21">25:1-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Where there is genuine repentance, God will graciously forgive his people and remit the penalty.

<p class="theme-title">God’s Judgment of His People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Although the kings of Israel and Judah had a major role in the history of the divided kingdom, the people also played a part in what occurred. As they followed their wicked rulers (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.3">2 Kgs 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.22">17:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.9">21:9</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.11">11</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.16">16</a>), their own hearts strayed from God (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.4">14:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.4">15:4</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.35">35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.9-11">17:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.17">22:17</a>). They participated in the religious practices initiated by Jeroboam I (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.28-31">10:28-31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.21-22">17:21-22</a>) and worshiped at pagan shrines (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.4">14:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.4">15:4</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.35">35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">18:4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Sometimes during this period, God’s people are portrayed positively. The people of Judah rejoiced over the removal of Athaliah and the installation of Joash as king (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.12">11:12</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.18-20">18-20</a>). At times, the people were instrumental in the succession of kings (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.21">14:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.30">23:30</a>) or were responsive to godly leadership (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.17">11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.36">18:36</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.1-3">23:1-3</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.21-23">21-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Yet despite God’s repeated warnings through his prophets (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.13">17:13</a>), the people of both kingdoms became set in their apostasy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.14-19">17:14-19</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.22">22</a>). So God’s righteous wrath burned against them and their leaders, and he brought his threatened judgment upon them (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.22-23">17:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.10-15">21:10-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.17">22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26-27">23:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.20">24:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.21">25:21</a>). God acted in accordance with the stipulations in his covenant with them (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.27-39">Lev 26:27-39</a>), even though he loved his people and longed to restore them (see <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1-11">Hos 11:1-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God never gave up caring for his people. He rescued them from Sennacherib (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17-19.37">2 Kgs 18:17–19:37</a>) and promised that a remnant would again thrive in the land (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.30-31">19:30-31</a>). Even the good treatment Jehoiachin received in Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27-30">25:27-30</a>) no doubt renewed hope among the repentant of God’s people.

<title>Seeking the Lord</title>
<refs>1Chr.16.11-13</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Seeking the Lord</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As Israel was on the verge of entering the Promised Land, Moses instructed the people to “seek the Lord . . . at the place of worship he himself will choose from among all the tribes” (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.5">Deut 12:5</a>). The Israelites were to rid the land of pagan worship practices and establish the centrality of the worship of God. In the wilderness, they constructed the Tabernacle as the place where God would manifest his presence and where the people would come to worship him. Once they were settled in the Promised Land, they were to build a more permanent sanctuary.</p>
<p class="theme-body">During the period of the judges, the people of Israel often sought the gods of the surrounding nations rather than the one true God. The establishment of the monarchy brought the hope that the entire nation would be unified in the worship of God. However, the first king, Saul, lost the kingdom and his life in part because he sought a medium rather than the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Chr.10.13-14">1 Chr 10:13-14</a>). Many of the kings throughout Israel’s history would follow Saul’s example of disobedience and would lead the nation into pagan religious practices.</p>
<p class="theme-body">David, by contrast, was a man after the Lord’s own heart (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.14">1 Sam 13:14</a>). As king, one of David’s chief concerns was to restore the prominence of the Ark of the Covenant, which the Israelites had neglected in the days of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Chr.13.3">1 Chr 13:3</a>). David failed in his first attempt to bring the Ark to Jerusalem because he and the Levites did not seek the Lord’s counsel regarding its transport (<a href="?bref=1Chr.13.1-14">13:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.13">15:13</a>). David later brought the Ark to Jerusalem successfully (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.1-16.1">15:1–16:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The sanctuary and worship in Jerusalem provided a crucial component in seeking the Lord. Once the Ark was situated in the tent prepared for it in Jerusalem, David established a new role for Levites as ministers of music (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.4-6">16:4-6</a>). And David consistently exhorted the leaders to “seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” in building the Temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.22.19">22:19</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.8-10">28:8-10</a>). Solomon’s first act to consolidate the kingdom was to gather all the leaders together at the altar at Gibeon in order to seek the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.1.1-6">2 Chr 1:1-6</a>). The Lord met Solomon there to grant him both wisdom and wealth like that of no other king. Later, Solomon completed the Temple and dedicated it as a place for seeking the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.1-42">2 Chr 6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Isaiah the prophet urged those waiting for the fulfillment of God’s promises to seek God: “Seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> while you can find him. Call on him now while he is near” (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.6">Isa 55:6</a>). God’s covenant and promise are certain (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.3">Isa 55:3</a>), and they are reserved for those who seek the Lord.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Promise of Dynasty</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God promised David that his dynasty would last forever (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.11-16">2 Sam 7:11-16</a> <span class="ital">//</span> <a href="?bref=1Chr.17.9-14">1 Chr 17:9-14</a>). Yet the Chronicler lived at a time when David’s dynasty had apparently ended. Although David’s line of descent continued (see <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.17-23">1 Chr 3:1-24</a>), no descendant of David had been king since the exile of Judah to Babylon over 150 years earlier. As a result, Israel’s hope for the future was in question. The Chronicler wanted to show that God’s promise to David was unconditional and that his throne was indeed “secure forever.” Even the possibility of exile does not remove the hope of God’s promise of a dynasty. The promise would continue for a future time because a future descendant of David would inherit the throne (<a href="?bref=1Chr.17.11">17:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Chronicler’s hope was not directly “messianic” in the strict sense—he was not primarily focused on the arising of an anointed deliverer. His continuing hope was that the covenant community would again be led by kings descended from David. The Chronicler encouraged the community to look to the future for a new king to improve Israel’s condition.</p>
<p class="theme-body">With the birth of Jesus, the Son of David, the Chronicler’s hope for the community of Israel was finally realized. Jesus is the fulfillment of the Chronicler’s expectation of a new king (see <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-17">Matt 1:1-17</a>). His Kingdom is for all the nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">Isa 49:6</a>), stretching “from sea to sea and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.10">Zech 9:10</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Temple Worship</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout the ancient Near East, it was a king’s responsibility to provide for his nation’s temple. David, the founder of the dynasty of Judah’s kings, established Jerusalem as the capital of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.4-10">2 Sam 5:4-10</a>) and made it the central place of worship. Although Solomon actually built the Temple, David prepared for the building of the Temple and for its liturgy.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It took Solomon seven years to build the Temple in Jerusalem, beginning in the fourth year of his reign (967 <span class="era">BC</span>). It was a large structure—90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high, with a vestibule 15 feet deep stretching across the width (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.2-10">1 Kgs 6:2-10</a>). It employed the most sophisticated building techniques of the age, and no expense was spared in construction, ornamentation, or equipment. Even so, Solomon readily confessed to its utter inadequacy to house the eternal God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Temple, located adjacent to the king’s palace, represented God’s reign over all creation and all nations: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is in his holy Temple. Let all the earth be silent before him” (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.20">Hab 2:20</a>). It served to teach Israel about God’s exclusive dominion and their total dependence on him. And although God cannot be confined to a building, he chose to make the Temple the focal point of his presence on earth. As such, the Temple was central for Israelite worship and for the personal relationship between God and his people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The kings were charged to devote themselves to God and to encourage the proper worship of God at his dwelling place, the Temple (see <a href="?bref=1Chr.22.17-19">1 Chr 22:17-19</a>). The Temple also established the legitimacy of the human king, who represented divine rule. This role of the Temple was expressed in <a href="?bref=Ps.132.1-18">Psalm 132</a>, which celebrated David’s restoration of the Ark to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ps.132.6-12">Ps 132:6-12</a>). This psalm was used at the conclusion of Solomon’s prayer of dedication (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.41-42">2 Chr 6:41-42</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Temple’s purpose in representing God’s presence in the world was later fulfilled in Christ and the church. Jesus himself signaled the transition from the Temple buildings to his own body as the temple (see <a href="?bref=John.2.19">John 2:19</a>), and the disciples began understanding this transition after the resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.2.21-22">John 2:21-22</a>). The apostle Paul later described the church as the new sacred space where Jews and Gentiles are reconciled. Using Temple imagery, he described breaking down barriers in the body of Christ, creating one people (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-15">Eph 2:14-15</a>). The church stands as a holy temple, resting on the foundation of the apostles and prophets (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.20-22">Eph 2:20-22</a>). It is built from living stones—believers—fashioned together around Jesus Christ, the cornerstone (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4-5">1 Pet 2:4-5</a>).</p>

<title>God’s Promised Kingdom</title>
<refs>1Chr.28.1-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Promised Kingdom</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God promised that his kingdom would come through David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.17.4-14">1 Chr 17:4-14</a>). During his reign, David himself made preparations for the building of the Temple as the focal point of God’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.11-19">28:11-19</a>). He also appealed to Israel’s leaders to seek the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.8-10">28:8-10</a>), and he encouraged the community of Israel to “be strong and courageous” in trusting God to provide (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.20-21">28:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Chronicler used these words of David to appeal to the citizens of Judea after the Exile to keep the hope of God’s kingdom alive. The Chronicler wanted the people to know that God’s promise to David, confirmed to Solomon, was equally confirmed for them. After the Exile, Judah no longer existed as an independent kingdom ruled by the dynasty of David. Instead, Judea stood as a small territory with limited independence under a Persian governor. Yet the community of Judea could experience God’s blessing, just as the people had in the days of Hezekiah and Josiah. The Chronicler did not know exactly how God’s promise to David would be realized. Yet he had complete trust in God’s power, sovereignty, and justice; he knew that God would be faithful to his promise and that his kingdom would eventually rule over all.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Following the time of the Chronicler, it appeared that his hopes were disappointed. The Greeks replaced the Persians as rulers of Israel; their intolerance for the Jewish community of faith reached its zenith in the tyrannical Antiochus IV “Epiphanes” (175–163 <span class="era">BC</span>), who made every effort to destroy Israel’s faith and identity, as Daniel had foreseen (<a href="?bref=Dan.11.21-39">Dan 11:21-39</a>). The priestly family of Maccabees resisted Antiochus, restored the Temple, and preserved Judea’s identity. But then the community disintegrated under the successors to the Maccabees; Israel fractured into sects (e.g., the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes) and eventually came under Roman control. When Jesus was born, Roman governors controlled the territory of Israel.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The fulfillment of God’s promises to David took place in a way the Chronicler did not anticipate. Jesus was the anointed king, the Messiah from the dynasty of David (see <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16-17">Matt 16:16-17</a>). His Kingdom was not established by the military defeat of the Romans but rather by the defeat of the powers of sin and death. His Kingdom continues to spread through his followers, and the powers of hell will never prevail against it. In the end, His Kingdom will be fully realized in the ultimate defeat of the powers of evil, and He will reign as King forever (see <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-20.15">Rev 19:11–20:15</a>).</p>

<refs>2Chr.2.1-4</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Name on His Temple</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In his prayer of dedication, Solomon declared that the Temple was the house where God’s name would be present (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.20">2 Chr 6:20</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.5-6">6:5-6</a>). God had promised David that he would place his own name on the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.4-17">2 Sam 7:4-17</a>). When God puts his name in a place, it signifies his possession of it.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For the people of Israel, the Temple embodied the land God promised to them and marked by his name. It was the ultimate symbol of God’s relationship with Israel. So Solomon prayed that God would remember his relationship with Israel and hear their prayers at this Temple. Solomon’s prayer uses God’s personal name (<span class="divine-name">Lord</span>=<span class="ital">Yahweh;</span> see <a href="?bref=Exod.3.13-15">Exod 3:13-15</a>) to make the Temple the definitive symbol of Israel’s faith. The Temple was the chosen place where the covenant was preserved, where the people of Israel called on God’s name and acknowledged God in confession and praise.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The fulfillment of God’s promise to put his name on his Temple is now to be found in the “living temple,” the community of God’s people. Peter urges believers to come “to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God’s temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honor. And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple. What’s more, you are his holy priests. Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4-5">1 Pet 2:4-5</a>). God’s name rests on his church as it did on his Temple.</p>

<title>God’s Plan to Restore</title>
<refs>2Chr.6.24-39</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Plan to Restore</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">One of the best known verses in Chronicles lays out God’s plan for Israel: “Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.7.14">2 Chr 7:14</a>). This verse expresses the Chronicler’s understanding of how God works with his people. The concept has been described as a “theology of immediate retribution”: Each person experiences the consequences for obedience or failure within his or her own lifetime.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The vocabulary of this verse (humble, pray, turn, seek, heal) appears repeatedly in the Chronicler’s writing as he shows this principle operating in the lives of the kings of Judah. The celebration of Passover during Hezekiah’s reign provides one of the most prominent examples. In the very first month of his reign, Hezekiah began to restore the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.3">29:3</a>). He extended an invitation to all Israel (including the people of the northern kingdom) to attend the Passover festival at Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.1">30:1</a>). When Hezekiah’s messengers urged the people to turn to the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.6">30:6</a>), many from the north humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.11">30:11</a>). So many people arrived that the Judeans could not accommodate them, and those from the north were not ready (ritually) to observe the Passover. Hezekiah prayed for the people as they resolved to seek the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.18-19">30:18-19</a>). The Lord indeed healed the people (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.20">30:20</a>), and they all were able to participate. The festival was going so well that it was extended another seven days (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.23">30:23</a>). Hezekiah followed the very principles that Solomon had enunciated in his prayer. Manasseh provides another encouraging example of God’s redemption at work (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.11-23">33:11-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Those familiar with Chronicles would have understood well the preaching of John the Baptist as he called for repentance and healing (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.5-12">Matt 3:5-12</a>). Failure to repent will result in judgment. But there is no situation beyond the reach of redemption for those willing to humble themselves before God.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Inscrutable Purposes in History</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God directs people and events to fulfill his purposes in history. He has no need to explain himself, but he always has a purpose that he is working out; he guides individuals, nations, and events in accord with his will. This philosophy of history remains consistent throughout biblical history. God works through human actions to bring about results that he has planned and that cannot be explained in any other way except his orchestration.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For example, the Chronicler gives just one explanation for the continued division of the kingdom of Israel: Rehoboam and those loyal to him “obeyed the message of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and did not fight against Jeroboam” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.4">2 Chr 11:4</a>). The cause of the division—the irrational response of Rehoboam to the people’s request—has already been explained in the previous narrative: “This turn of events was the will of God, for it fulfilled the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s message to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.10.15">10:15</a>). Rehoboam may have been able to easily defeat the rebels, but he was deterred by the will of the Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Obedience to God’s will brought positive results for Rehoboam: He fortified cities; he put military leaders, equipment, and food supplies in place; loyal citizens migrated to his territory; and he had a large family. God’s will was clear, and the benefit to Rehoboam was obvious, yet the Chronicler could not explain God’s purposes. Readers of the book today are also left to ponder why God allowed the kingdom to remain divided.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The prophet Isaiah declares the mystery of God’s ways: “‘My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts,’ says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. ‘And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine. For just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts’” (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.8-9">Isa 55:8-9</a>). Those who fear God learn not to lean on human understanding, but to follow the word of God even when it is contrary to earthly values.</p>

<title>Trusting in Human Strength</title>
<refs>2Chr.16.1-10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Trusting in Human Strength</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God had repeatedly displayed his power to his people throughout their history. He took a barren elderly couple and made them the progenitors of a great nation. He rescued this nation from the clutches of the powerful tyrant, Egypt. He performed numerous miracles in preserving them in the wilderness. And he had secured victory over their enemies many times during the conquest, the period of the judges, and the monarchical period. Yet, throughout their history, the people of Israel demonstrated a lack of trust in the Lord, instead opting to trust in human strength.</p>
<p class="theme-body">On one occasion, Asa, king of Judah, sought help from the king of Aram—a perennial enemy of God’s people—giving him the treasures of the Temple and palace so he would attack Baasha, king of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.1-6">2 Chr 16:1-6</a>). The prophet Hanani chastised Asa, seeing in Aram a human foe who would continue to be a nemesis to the kingdom of Judah. Previous battles demonstrated that God was the only ally Asa needed (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.8">16:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Asa’s reliance on the king of Aram revealed a much deeper spiritual problem. Asa forgot that “the eyes of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> search the whole earth” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.9">16:9</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Zech.4.10">Zech 4:10</a>). So when Hanani confronted Asa with the error of his ways, Asa summarily threw the prophet into confinement, and the angry king arbitrarily inflicted cruelties on the people (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.10">2 Chr 16:10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Asa provides a sad example of the human propensity to rely on one’s own tangible resources (see <a href="?bref=Pr.11.7">Prov 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.31.1">Isa 31:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.5-6">Jer 17:5-6</a>) and to become angry when corrected. Even those who experience the power of the Lord in a very tangible fashion often have this leaning; this was quite true of the generation of Israelites who had been rescued by God from slavery in Egypt. It is much better to rely on the Lord and welcome his direction (cp. <a href="?bref=Ps.33.18">Pss 33:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.37.7">37:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.10">Isa 50:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.7-8">Jer 17:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.43">Acts 13:43</a>). Life is a long lesson in trusting God; we might begin by doing what is good and right (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.1-6">2 Chr 14:1-6</a>), but our legacy is not settled until the last deed is done (see <a href="?bref=Rom.2.6-11">Rom 2:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.1-5">1 Cor 4:1-5</a>). Faithfulness to the Kingdom of God must not be compromised by personal ambitions.</p>

<p class="theme-title">God as Holy Warrior</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Arabic term <span class="ital">jihad,</span> which has become well known in the English language, speaks of a “holy war” in which men fight for God. However, the biblical description of a “holy war” is quite different. A holy war is a conflict where God fights for his people while they trust in him. In these wars, victory does not depend on weapons but on obedience to God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In a time of war, King Jehoshaphat of Judah proclaimed a fast (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.3">2 Chr 20:3</a>) and petitioned God in the typical style of a prayer lament (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.5-12">20:5-12</a>), which included an invocation, a complaint, a confession of trust, and a request. Jehoshaphat and the people reflected their hearts’ attitude by bowing low with their faces to the ground (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.18">20:18</a>). The image of an army marching into battle headed by a choir giving praise to God (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.21">20:21</a>) is startling, because the battlefield is not usually the place for worship and praise. However, worship provides a way to know the will of God, and it invites God to act to save his people. God rewards acts of trust in him, and in Jehoshaphat’s case, God brought about the defeat of a large coalition of enemy forces without Israel having to even draw their swords (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.22-24">20:22-24</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament portrays Jesus as the conqueror of all the principalities and powers that are arrayed against the Kingdom of God (see <a href="?bref=Eph.1.19-21">Eph 1:19-21</a>). In the end, Jesus will accomplish the ultimate defeat of all enemy forces (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.24-28">1 Cor 15:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-20.15">Rev 19:11–20.15</a>). In bringing this ultimate victory of God as king, worship will be complete: “Praise the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>!

<title>Violation of the Sacred</title>
<refs>2Chr.26.16-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Violation of the Sacred</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Ever since Eden, humans have attempted to take God’s sacred space as their own (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.15-17">Gen 2:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>). Scripture shows us God’s anger and swift punishment when people treat his holy commands with contempt or casual disdain. Nadab and Abihu were supposed to lead Israel in proper worship, so when they ignored God’s specific instructions about priestly duties, they lost their lives for their sin (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-20">Lev 10:1-20</a>). Jesus himself expressed the righteous anger of God when he entered the Temple with a whip and drove out the merchants and money changers who were defiling the holy space for their own profit (<a href="?bref=John.2.13-16-20">John 2:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">There can be no violations with respect to God’s holy presence, and that certainly included the Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple represented God’s presence in creation, so all of its rituals needed to reflect its status as sacred and set apart for God alone. This meant that no one could enter it to make offerings except those anointed for the task.</p>
<p class="theme-body">One particularly egregious sin was when King Uzziah entered the Temple to burn incense (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.16">2 Chr 26:16</a>). The kings of Israel (unlike kings of other ancient Near Eastern cultures) were excluded from the sacred space because they were anointed only for the secular function of government. The king of Israel was not a priest. He was not God’s representative in sacred matters nor (as in other cultures) a god himself. He was a servant of God taken from among his brothers to administer the covenant in the community (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.18-20">Deut 17:18-20</a>). So when King Uzziah tried to claim a priestly function that was not rightfully his, he violated the sanctuary that God had set apart for his own presence. In terms of the function of the Temple, this violation was no trivial matter.</p>
<p class="theme-body">David provides a counterpoint to Uzziah’s arrogance (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-9">1 Sam 21:1-9</a>). When his men were hungry, he knew they could find bread at the Tabernacle, but instead of claiming it for himself, he made his request to the priest, who gave them the holy bread with his blessing. By contrast, when Uzziah entered the Temple and violated this sacred space, his response was typical of arrogant human hearts (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.16">26:16</a>). He assumed that, as king, he had the right to enter God’s sacred Temple. But he did not have that right, and he was judged with affliction by a skin disease and separation from daily life. The punishment was appropriate to the arrogance of his sin.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Uzziah-like sacrilege remains an ever-present temptation. Any conduct that fails to glorify God is a violation of his sacred space. All of human history consists of the story of God restoring the entire heavens and earth to be the place of his dwelling. In the new covenant through Jesus Christ, God’s sacred space is not limited to a Temple in Jerusalem or any other building; he sets apart for himself the lives of people who trust in him (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19-20">1 Cor 6:19-20</a>). In his grace, God has made the people of the new covenant to be his temple on earth (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4-5">1 Pet 2:4-5</a>), to be the space where his holiness enters creation. History will be complete when all of heaven and earth becomes the temple of God (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17-18">Isa 65:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-2">Rev 21:1-2</a>).</p>

<refs>2Chr.28.1-31.21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Apostasy and Renewal</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">During the divided monarchy, a distinction was often made between the apostate northern kingdom and the faithful remnant of Judah. When Jeroboam founded the northern kingdom, a number of righteous people went to Judah to escape Jeroboam’s wickedness (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.13-17">2 Chr 11:13-17</a>). But eventually, the southern kingdom also fell into apostasy. Ahaz became like Jeroboam: He made metal images (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.2">28:2</a>), worshiped the gods of Damascus (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.23">28:23</a>), neglected the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.24">28:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.7">29:7</a>, <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.19">19</a>), and spread false worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.24-25">28:24-25</a>). His apostasy was so great that more righteousness was found in the north at that time than in Judah (see <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.9-15">28:9-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Chronicler wrote to inspire hope that God would restore Judah. He showed that God is always willing to forgive those who repent. Repentance can make restoration and reconciliation possible, as shown by the northern leaders’ response to the prophet who confronted the victorious northern army (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.8-15">28:8-15</a>). The renewal of Judah under Hezekiah also provided a paradigm for restoration and unification, a time that could be compared with Solomon’s reign. In the first year of his reign, Hezekiah began to restore the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.3">29:3</a>); and when Hezekiah celebrated the Passover, he invited people from the northern kingdom, showing that both kingdoms could worship together at the place God had chosen (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.18-20">30:18-20</a>). The glory of Solomon’s time was temporarily restored (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.26">30:26</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.8-10">7:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Even exile did not bring an end to the covenant community. Healing was possible at any time the people chose to seek the Lord, whether at the occasion of returning with spoils of war, or reuniting at the Passover festival. Many of the Old Testament prophets who proclaimed judgment on apostate Judah or Israel also spoke of future renewal and restoration. The continual hope of renewal also holds true for the church, even when threatened with extinction from persecution or corruption (see <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">Rev 2–3</a>). God’s Kingdom stands on the solid rock of his promises (see <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matt 16:18</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Spirit of the Law</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In seeking to celebrate the Passover, Hezekiah faced a dilemma. The Passover, a celebration of Israel’s redemption from Egypt, was the first festival of Israel’s liturgical year (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-2">Exod 12:1-2</a>). Hezekiah had worked to restore Israel’s worship of the Lord. But the time between the beginning of his renewal and the first month of the year did not allow the priests sufficient time to be prepared and to gather the people (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.2-3">2 Chr 30:2-3</a>). As a result, he could not celebrate the Passover at the scheduled time.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Hezekiah proceeded with the Passover, holding it a month late (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.15">30:15</a>). He deemed having the celebration to be more important than holding it at the prescribed time. By deferring the date with the express purpose of allowing time for the people to gather at the Temple in Jerusalem, Hezekiah achieved harmony between Judah and the people from the northern kingdom and unified the celebration.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The precise regulations were less important than ensuring that the Passover was observed and that all could participate. Also, when the festival began, many of the people were not properly purified, so they were unable to slaughter their own sacrifices as the law required. Again, Hezekiah determined that it was more important for people to participate in the Passover than to meet the precise regulations. Hezekiah prayed for the pilgrims who had no opportunity to be properly prepared; they were not allowed to make the sacrifice in a state of impurity, but they were allowed to participate in the Passover. The right heart attitude and seeking the Lord in prayer brought God’s gracious acceptance (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.18-20">30:18-20</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.27-34">1 Cor 11:27-34</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus was often criticized by the religious leaders of his day for failing to observe certain aspects of the law, especially regarding Sabbath observance and purity. Jesus’ teaching and actions conveyed that it was more important to demonstrate love toward others than to follow every minute detail of the law. He also spoke harshly of the religious leaders’ own tendency to prioritize the particularities of law observance over the principles that undergird the law. While strict law observance was foundational to Jewish identity, the spirit of the law allowed for a measure of adaptability in certain circumstances.</p>

<title>Purity and Identity</title>
<refs>Ezra.4.1-5</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Purity and Identity</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God is holy, and he made a covenant with Israel to establish a holy nation (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.4-6">Exod 19:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lev 19:2</a>). Israel’s identity as God’s people required purity in worship and in social relationships. God knew that if his people mingled with their pagan neighbors, they would be drawn into their detestable worship practices (see <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-9">Num 25:1-9</a>). Their failure to maintain purity and their assimilation to the surrounding cultures ultimately led to their destruction and exile (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Ezra wrote to the Jews who had returned to Jerusalem, one of his main purposes was to remind them of their need to remain pure in their beliefs and commitments. After arriving in Jerusalem, Ezra found that the people had intermarried with pagan foreigners, even though doing so was not permitted in God’s law (see <a href="?bref=Deut.7.3-4">Deut 7:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.12-13">Josh 23:12-13</a>). As a result, their identity as God’s holy nation was in danger of disintegrating once again (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1-2">Ezra 9:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">To impress on his readers the need for separation from these foreigners, Ezra recounts how those who first returned to Jerusalem refused to cooperate with the pagan people living around them (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-5">4:1-5</a>). These people claimed to worship the same God, but they actually worshiped several gods in addition to Israel’s God. If the Jews had joined with these people, they soon would have compromised their beliefs and become ungodly, just as Israel had done before the Exile (see <a href="?bref=Exod.34.15-16">Exod 34:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-5">1 Kgs 11:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.3">2 Kgs 16:3</a>). Those early leaders of the Jews in Judea understood the danger of accommodating these foreigners. They learned from their ancestors’ experience and refused to compromise the purity of their faith for the sake of peace. They carefully followed God’s instructions in everything they did (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2">Ezra 3:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.9">9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.18">6:18</a>). If they were going to identify themselves as “the servants of the God of heaven and earth” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.11">5:11</a>), they would need to please and serve him and no other gods.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Believers today are identified as God’s holy people (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pet 2:9</a>), a title that speaks of purity. Paul admonished the Corinthians to refrain from marrying unbelievers—for Christ and Satan have no fellowship (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-15">2 Cor 6:14-15</a>). Righteousness and unrighteousness do not mix. The people of God must dissociate themselves from all behavior that defiles, instead clothing themselves with attitudes and actions that befit their holy status (<a href="?bref=Col.3.5-15">Col 3:5-15</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Completion of the Second Temple</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The dedication of Israel’s second Temple on March 12, 515 <span class="era">BC</span>, was the most significant event in the lives of those who returned from Babylonian exile. Now they could worship and praise God in the same way their ancestors had worshiped before the Exile, and God’s requirements for covenant relationship with him could be fulfilled. The high priest could go into God’s presence to sprinkle the blood once a year on the Day of Atonement for the nation’s sins. After seventy years of estrangement from God, the covenant community was now restored.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This joyous event did not come without difficulty. With God’s help, the returned exiles overcame sixteen years of opposition from the people who had inhabited their land and from Persian officials. Although their enemies made every attempt to discourage them, the Israelites completed the job of rebuilding the Temple and reestablishing worship through patience, persistence, and strong prophetic encouragement (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-5">Ezra 5:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.14">6:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The dedication of the Temple demonstrates that God can accomplish his will through a small group of people who set their priorities on pleasing him and who trust him to provide the resources to fulfill his promises (see <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.6-9">Hag 2:6-9</a>). Instead of focusing on what little they had, the people of God trusted in what he could provide. They were dedicated to glorifying God and maintaining their relationship with him. God proved that he was sovereignly in control of nations and could change the hearts of the leaders of those nations to accomplish his will (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.5">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.6-12">6:6-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.22">22</a>).</p>

<title>Intermarriage and Divorce</title>
<refs>Ezra.9.1-10.44</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Intermarriage and Divorce</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God had warned his people not to intermarry with unbelieving foreigners (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-6">Deut 7:1-6</a>). The sin was not that they married people from another country or race but that they married people committed to other gods. Moses had married a Cushite woman (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1">Num 12:1</a>), and other foreigners had joined Israel through marriage, notably Rahab the Canaanite (see <a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Matt 1:5</a>) and Ruth the Moabite (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.1-22">Ruth 4:1-22</a>). These women embraced faith in the Lord, and they were blessed. On the other hand, Solomon had taken many foreign wives, and their devotion to other gods led him into idolatry, just as the Lord had warned (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-5">1 Kgs 11:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The marriage covenant is sacred, but it was even more important for Israel to remain faithful to the Lord’s covenant with them as a people. Mixed marriages would produce children who were not fully committed to Israel’s faith, having been influenced by their foreign parent’s idolatrous beliefs. This compromise would lead Israel back to where they were before the Exile—to wholesale unfaithfulness to God and a wholehearted embrace of false religions (see <a href="?bref=Judg.3.3-7">Judg 3:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.1-9">14:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-8">1 Kgs 11:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.7-17">2 Kgs 17:7-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In <a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1-10.44">Ezra 9 and 10</a>, the Jews who had returned from exile had married people who served other gods. Ezra’s solution (divorce) is not prescriptive for believers today. In the new covenant under Christ, the faith of a believer sanctifies his or her marriage and children, so marriage to an unbeliever does not threaten the identity or purity of the community of God’s people (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.14-16">1 Cor 7:14-16</a>). The apostle Paul realized that divorce might occur when believers and unbelievers married, but he did not encourage believers in that situation to seek a divorce (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.10-13">1 Cor 7:10-13</a>). Certainly, the wise policy to avoid these problems is to heed Paul’s advice not to marry an unbeliever in the first place. God’s people need to remain separated from what is unholy: “How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-15">2 Cor 6:14-15</a>). But those who are married to an unbeliever today have God’s assurance that he can use that difficult situation for his glory (see also <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-2">1 Pet 3:1-2</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">God Works through Prayer</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Although God is sovereign over all creation, he desires for his people to bring their concerns to him in prayer. Throughout the Bible, we see examples of God acting in response to the prayers of his people. Prayer is essential for anyone who desires to live a godly life and carry out an effective ministry, as it is the means by which God’s people align their will with his.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The brief account relayed in the book of Nehemiah exhibits a man whose life was steeped in prayer. In response to Jerusalem’s disgraceful condition, Nehemiah spent four months in intensive intercessory prayer (cp. <a href="?bref=Neh.1.1">Neh 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">2:1</a>). His prayers included praising God for his power and covenant love, confessing the nation’s sins, and calling on God to act (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.4-11">1:4-11</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Ezra.9.6-15">Ezra 9:6-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.4-19">Dan 9:4-19</a>). Nehemiah based his prayer for Jerusalem on God’s “covenant of unfailing love with those who love him and obey his commands” (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.5">1:5</a>). The Israelites had not obeyed the instructions God gave to Moses (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.7">1:7</a>), resulting in the exile of the nation as God had warned. However, Nehemiah was firmly convinced that God would keep his promise to restore the nation if the people repented (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.8-9">1:8-9</a>; see <a href="?bref=Deut.4.25-31">Deut 4:25-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.1-5">30:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When God presented an opening for Nehemiah to approach the Persian king about returning to Jerusalem, Nehemiah immediately prayed for God’s guidance (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.4">Neh 2:4</a>). He knew that only God could change the king’s heart. Later, Nehemiah made a practical and balanced response to threats against those building the wall by posting guards and rallying the people, all while praying for God’s protection and strength (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.4-5">4:4-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.4.9">9</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.9">6:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.6.14">14</a>). He needed God’s help and blessing then and in the future as he confronted people who acted improperly.</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem after a brief visit to Persia, he found that some Jews were not contributing their tithe (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.10-12">13:10-12</a>), some were not keeping the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-16">13:15-16</a>), and some had married unbelievers (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-24">13:23-24</a>). When confronting these people about their sin, Nehemiah prayed for God to have compassion on him and remember what he had done (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.14">13:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.13.22">22</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.13.31">31</a>). Nehemiah knew that he had to depend on God’s power to transform people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Even Jesus, who already had a keen awareness of the Father’s will, bathed his ministry in prayer (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Luke.5.16">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.12-16">6:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.18">9:18</a>). Following his example, the early Christians spent much time in prayer, operating with a firm belief in its effectiveness (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.9.36-41">9:36-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.3-11">12:3-11</a>). God often responds powerfully to his people’s prayers, and believers are encouraged to pray with eager expectation (see <a href="?bref=Jas.5.16-18">Jas 5:16-18</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Rebuilding of Jerusalem</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The wall of Jerusalem had great political, social, and religious significance for the people of Judah (see <a href="?bref=Neh.2.10">Neh 2:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-15">4:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-14">6:1-14</a>). In the ancient world and up to the modern era, a city without walls would not remain a city for long. Walls protected a city both from invading nations and from common criminals. By Nehemiah’s time, the walls of Jerusalem had lain in ruins for over a hundred years, since the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The destroyed wall was a shameful reminder that God had brought punishment on the city, fulfilling the covenant curses because of the people’s sin (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.2-7">1:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.17">2:17</a>). Consequently, the rebuilt wall would be a sign of God’s blessing and proof that God was bringing the promised restoration to his covenant people. Israel’s enemies knew that if the wall was rebuilt, the Jews would gain political power, security, and self-determination; so they fiercely opposed the rebuilding.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Under Nehemiah’s leadership, the inhabitants of Judea rebuilt the entire wall in only fifty-two days during the fall of 445 <span class="era">BC</span>. The speed and success of the reconstruction is a witness to all believers that with God’s help, his people can accomplish amazing things (see <a href="?bref=Neh.2.18">2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.14-15">4:14-15</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.4.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.16">6:16</a>).</p>

<title>Dealing with Conflict</title>
<refs>Neh.2.9-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Dealing with Conflict</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God’s people often have to deal with conflict, either from those outside the community who are opposed to God and his purposes or from those inside the community who cause strife and division. Dealing with conflict requires a great deal of wisdom and tact, as even the smallest conflicts can turn disastrous. Paul faced opposition from government (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.22-24">Acts 16:22-24</a>) and community leaders (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-34">Acts 19:23-34</a>). Moses dealt with the grumbling and dissatisfied people of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.23-34">e.g., Exod 17:1-4</a>). The book of Nehemiah provides perhaps the most comprehensive example of how a godly person can respond to conflict.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nehemiah faced both external and internal opposition to all that God was directing him to do. External opposition came from foreigners such as Sanballat, Geshem, and Tobiah. They fiercely opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls and mocked Nehemiah’s leadership (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.10">Neh 2:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>). The opposition gradually grew to include other Arabs, Ammonites, and people from Ashdod, who plotted to attack the builders (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.7-9">4:7-9</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.4.11">11</a>). To meet this opposition, Nehemiah posted guards, prayed for God’s help, developed an emergency warning system, and kept working (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.6-23">4:6-23</a>). Israel’s frustrated enemies made several attempts to disgrace or kill Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-14">6:1-14</a>). However, Nehemiah had the wisdom to avoid or frustrate their plots while focusing on the task God had given him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nehemiah also faced internal problems. Wealthy Jews were mistreating the poor by charging high interest (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-13">5:1-13</a>). Jews had married foreigners who worshiped other gods (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-30">13:23-30</a>). Many were not tithing or keeping the Sabbath holy (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.31-39">10:31-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.10-22">13:10-22</a>). Finally, he had to oppose the priest Eliashib, who had allowed Tobiah to use one of the Temple storerooms (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.4-9">13:4-9</a>). Confronting these problems required a firm commitment to the principles explained in Scripture, boldness in insisting that people follow these divine instructions, and compassion in restoring people to fellowship after the confrontation.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In each of these cases, Nehemiah courageously followed the example of earlier leaders such as Moses, who opposed the worship of the gold calf (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Exod 32</a>); Samuel, who opposed those involved with Baal worship (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.3-8">1 Sam 7:3-8</a>); Nathan, who opposed David’s sins (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.1-14">2 Sam 12:1-14</a>); and Jehoshaphat, who trusted in God to defeat a much stronger enemy (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.1-37">2 Chr 20:1-37</a>). Like these earlier men of God, Nehemiah took a stand for what was right instead of letting those for whom he was responsible go their own ways. He refused to be discouraged or intimidated by internal difficulties or external threats against him. He consistently depended on God for wisdom and for blessing on his work.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus and Paul both outlined some strategies for dealing with internal conflict (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.23-26">Matt 5:23-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.15-17">18:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.1-8">1 Cor 6:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.23-33">10:23-33</a>) and external conflict (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-47">Matt 5:43-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.14-21">Rom 12:14-21</a>). Unfortunately, the actions of believers, no matter how upstanding, will sometimes be met with continued—or even increased—opposition. Nonetheless, we are called to handle opposition in a way similar to Nehemiah—with wisdom, patience, prayer, and resolve.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Centrality of God’s Word</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When God gave the Law to his people at Sinai, it was written in stone (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.1">Exod 34:1</a>) and was to be taught to children (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.7">Deut 6:7</a>), worn on the hands and forehead, and written on doorposts (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.8-9">Deut 6:8-9</a>), so that people would constantly be reminded of what God had said. God’s instructions were also to be read to the people every seven years so that they would remember to fear God (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.9-13">Deut 31:9-13</a>). Success depended on meditating on God’s word and following it (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.7-8">Josh 1:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.1.2">Pss 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.15">119:15</a>). Obedience was far more important than offering sacrifices (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.22">1 Sam 15:22</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">But when God’s people neglect his Word and take their eyes off his truth, we have a tendency to fall away from the life he envisions for us. In the time of Josiah, even the priests had lost and forgotten the Book of the Law. When it was discovered in the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.8-13">2 Kgs 22:8-13</a>), the young king read it and tore his clothing, realizing how the nation had forsaken the covenant.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the fall of 445 <span class="era">BC</span>, Nehemiah finished rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem. Just five days later, on the first day of the seventh month, the settlers in Judah came together to celebrate the Festival of Trumpets. During and after the festival, Ezra read from the Law, and as the people listened they mourned and wept, for they realized they had not obeyed God’s law. They confessed their sins, studied God’s word to learn what he required, and obeyed what they learned. The Book of the Law of Moses thus transformed their lives and behavior.</p>
<p class="theme-body">These events provide a dramatic reminder that God’s word is central to the lives of his people. God’s word provides the essential guide to life or death (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">Gen 2:16-17</a>), and his promises prove true (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-21">Gen 17:15-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.10-14">18:10-14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s word is perfect. It has the power to restore, make wise, and give joy (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.7-9">Ps 19:7-9</a>).

It sheds light on their paths (<a href="?bref=Ps.119.105">Ps 119:105</a>) and keeps them from sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.119.9">Ps 119:9</a>). God’s word accomplishes its purpose (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.11">Isa 55:11</a>) and remains perpetually relevant (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.17-19">Matt 5:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.35">24:35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.14-17">2 Tim 3:14-17</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Nehemiah’s Confidence in God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God gave Nehemiah favor in the eyes of a mighty Persian king so that the king responded favorably to all of Nehemiah’s requests (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.11">Neh 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.8">2:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.2.18">18</a>). Nehemiah then had the confidence to present his bold plan to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, and the people of Jerusalem responded positively, believing that God was able to give them success (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.18">2:18</a>) and to protect them from their enemies (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.4-5">4:4-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.4.9">9</a>). They confidently continued with their work in spite of opposition because they knew that God fights for his people and frustrates the plans of the wicked (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.14-15">4:14-15</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.4.20">20</a>). When the walls of Jerusalem were finished, Nehemiah recognized that the entire difficult project was completed only because of God’s help (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.16">6:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Nehemiah vividly demonstrates that God is all-powerful and able to accomplish his will, both in individual lives and in nations. The prayer in <a href="?bref=Neh.9.1-38">Nehemiah 9</a> focuses on praising God for his sovereign and powerful acts: God created the heavens and earth (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.6">9:6</a>), called Abram from Ur, and gave the land to Israel (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.7-8">9:7-8</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.9.22-25">22-25</a>). The miraculous signs in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of guidance, food, and water in the wilderness all demonstrate God’s power over man and nature to provide for his people (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.9-15">9:9-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord had sent the Israelites into exile after generations of persistent sin (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.32-37">9:32-37</a>). Now he was fulfilling part of his promise to restore them (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.8-9">1:8-9</a>). Nehemiah had the confidence to pray and lead because he knew that everything that happened was part of God’s sovereign plan. This same confidence in God led Abram to leave Ur and by faith go to an unknown land (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gen 12:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.8-10">Heb 11:8-10</a>), caused Rahab to trust in God (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.9-14">Josh 2:9-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.31">Heb 11:31</a>), and prompted Hezekiah not to give in to the demands of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-19.37">2 Kgs 18:1–19:37</a>).

<p class="theme-title">Ethnic Hatred</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Selfish pride, a desire to maintain power, and hatred for those who stand in the way have often been the basis for the persecution of racial or religious groups. Many people have died through the centuries because of such hatred.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the book of Esther, Haman hated Mordecai because Mordecai would not bow down as everyone else did when Haman passed by (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.1-5">Esth 3:1-5</a>). Haman thus despised a man of integrity who would not obey laws that were against his convictions. This personal hatred of Mordecai the Jew developed into a murderous desire to destroy all Jews (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.6">3:6</a>). His charge against the Jewish people was what he hated in Mordecai: They did not assimilate with other people, they had unique laws and customs, and they did not obey some of the laws of the king (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.8">3:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Spanish Inquisition (1400s) and the Holocaust in Nazi Germany (1930s–40s) were other terrible attempts to wipe the Jewish people off the face of the earth. Religious and ethnic hatred still leads to diabolical plans today.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God disapproves of such hatred against any ethnic or religious group, and he will eventually hold accountable those who attempt to carry out such plots (see <a href="?bref=Deut.30.7">Deut 30:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.21.7-11">Pss 21:7-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.19-21">34:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.7">44:7</a>). God has repeatedly saved the Jewish people and defeated their enemies, for God is faithful to all his promises (see <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">Rom 9–11</a>). He will similarly preserve his church through all persecution (see <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matt 16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.26-39">Rom 8:26-39</a>).</p>

<title>Purim</title>
<refs>Esth.9.1-32</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Purim</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Festival of Purim is the only Old Testament festival not established during the time of Moses. Its name is derived from a word that means <span class="ital">lots</span> or <span class="ital">dice</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">purim</span>, derived from Akkadian <span class="ital">puru</span>). It was a common practice in the ancient world to cast <span class="ital">purim</span> to determine whether God favored a particular course of action: A good number would indicate God’s approval, a bad number his disapproval. Near the king’s throne room at Susa in Persia, archaeologists found a small four-sided object with a number engraved on each side. A similar die inscribed with the word <span class="ital">pur</span> dates to the 800s <span class="era">BC</span>. In the book of Esther, the Persian astrologers used <span class="ital">purim</span> to establish the best time to slaughter the Jews (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.7">Esth 3:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">On the fateful day—March 7, 473 <span class="era">BC</span>—God miraculously rescued his people from certain death, just as he had rescued the nation from Egypt at the Passover. Mordecai and Esther therefore formalized an annual celebration of God’s rescue so that all future generations would remember what God had accomplished (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.28">9:28</a>). The festival was widely celebrated thereafter among Jews (see <span class="ital">2 Maccabees</span> 15:36; Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 11.6.13; perhaps <a href="?bref=John.5.1">John 5:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When God rescued his chosen people, the day for Jewish execution turned into a day of holy vengeance and was followed by a day of celebration. Today, Jewish people fast and pray to commemorate Esther’s fasting. This fast is then followed by Purim, which is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar (occurring in February or March). On this joyous holiday Jews read Esther (with loud <span class="ital">boo</span>s for Haman and <span class="ital">hooray</span>s for Mordecai) and have a time of feasting and rejoicing, with gifts for friends and for the poor. It is a celebration of how God providentially worked to care for his people so that they were not exterminated (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.1-17">9:1-17</a>) and of how God continues to care for, provide for, and save his people (see also <a href="?bref=Gen.45.5">Gen 45:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.91.1-16">Ps 91</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.9">Prov 16:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.16.33">33</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.21">Dan 2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-7">Acts 1:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.22-23">2:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.28-30">4:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.24-27">17:24-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.28">Rom 8:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.12">1 Pet 3:12</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Complaints</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Bible generally depicts complaining as wrong. For example, God judged the Israelites for grumbling about their hardships in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Num.14.27-37">Num 14:27-37</a>). Job complained mightily and earned God’s rebuke for it, yet God ultimately confirmed Job’s righteousness and rejected those who tried to stop him from complaining (<a href="?bref=Job.42.7-8">Job 42:7-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Job’s fundamental complaint was that God did not give him a fair hearing to demonstrate his innocence. Job’s friends attacked him for trying to vindicate himself, but God upheld Job’s innocence. In a gracious but firm act of self-revelation, God rebuked Job for his overreaching self-defense and implied criticism of God’s fairness. God shifted Job’s focus away from his troubles and toward God himself (<a href="?bref=Job.38.1-41.34">Job 38–41</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Scripture admonishes us to rejoice and give thanks in all situations (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.20">Eph 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.4">Phil 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.16-18">1 Thes 5:16-18</a>). It also calls us to endure through suffering and to persist in prayer (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.10-18">Jas 5:10-18</a>). If we do want to complain in prayer, we should follow the pattern of the psalms, which lead us past ourselves and back to God (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.13.1-6">Ps 13</a>). Job’s positive example (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.11">Jas 5:11</a>) is not so much in how he responded to his troubles or to his comforters but in how he responded to God (<a href="?bref=Job.40.3-5">Job 40:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.42.1-6">42:1-6</a>). In the midst of difficult and confusing situations that may precipitate a desire to complain, we can still acknowledge the sovereignty and goodness of God.</p>

<title>Material Reward</title>
<refs>Job.4.7-9</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Material Reward</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">It was a common Old Testament belief that righteous people would always prosper materially. They interpreted contemporary wisdom (as in the book of Proverbs) as a universal rule. Some hold this view today. One problem with this theology is that it can induce false guilt and accusations when prosperity does not come (and spiritual complacency when it does come).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Job’s suffering provides an example. His friends accepted this traditional theological view. They said that Job’s troubles stood as evidence against him (<a href="?bref=Job.19.5">19:5</a>). They claimed that his suffering was punishment for his sin (<a href="?bref=Job.4.7-9">4:7-9</a>) and believed that Job’s penalty was probably less than he deserved (<a href="?bref=Job.11.6">11:6</a>). However, God’s analysis of Job’s life proved this idea to be false (<a href="?bref=Job.42.7-8">42:7-8</a>). God testified to his special relationship with Job and restored Job’s good reputation as his servant.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Material well-being is not necessarily in opposition to spiritual blessing. Once we equate blessings with material gain, however, “the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things” tend to crowd out our attention to spiritual blessings (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.19">Mark 4:19</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Luke.6.25">Luke 6:25</a>). We can easily shift to greed, covetousness, and lust. And our self-esteem can come to be based on what we own (even if we still owe many payments on it). This worldview is not Christian but characterizes worldly people (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.15-17">1 Jn 2:15-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In his suffering, Job moved from complaint to renewed humility as he acknowledged God’s righteous power (<a href="?bref=Job.40.4-5">Job 40:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.42.2-6">42:2-6</a>). We, too, can regard hardships as occasions for spiritual growth (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.2-4">Jas 1:2-4</a>).</p>

<title>The Righteous Suffer</title>
<refs>Job.9.33-35</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Righteous Suffer</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The book of Job invites us to examine the basis of our faith in God. Job’s loss of possessions and family members and the alienation of his friends shook his faith to its foundation. However, he maintained his trust in God, and he proved Satan’s accusations to be lies.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Sin undoubtedly brings suffering, but as the book of Job demonstrates, suffering is not necessarily the result of one’s sin. Human suffering is more complex than a simple equation of individual behavior and consequence. Some today blindly follow Job’s friends in equating godliness with material blessing. But at its root, this perspective is flawed, as demonstrated by the many examples throughout history of righteous suffering—including, of course, Christ himself. As believers we are told that “we must also share [Christ’s] suffering” and “what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.17-18">Rom 8:17-18</a>). At the core of being a disciple of Christ is a willingness to follow him into suffering (see <a href="?bref=Luke.9.23-25">Luke 9:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.10-11">Phil 3:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Even in his complaints, Job acknowledged that only God could provide the answers he needed. When Job wished for death, it was to gain relief until God could deal with him under more favorable conditions (<a href="?bref=Job.14.13">14:13</a>). When Job desired a mediator (<a href="?bref=Job.9.33-35">9:33-35</a>), it was to facilitate finding favor with God. When Job complained that God didn’t listen, it was because he knew that his answers had to come from God (see <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">19:25-27</a>). That is the very essence of faith.</p>
<p class="theme-body">We are not meant to know or understand everything (see <a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">Gen 2:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.29.29">Deut 29:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.7">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-2">1 Thes 5:1-2</a>). Some things are for God alone to comprehend and direct according to his sovereign will. Our response is to live by faith. Even when we suffer, we can trust God (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.26-39">Rom 8:26-39</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Counsel from Others</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The book of Proverbs teaches that many counselors are good because they provide safety (<a href="?bref=Pr.11.14">Prov 11:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.24.6">24:6</a>) and improve our odds of success (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.22">Prov 15:22</a>). The book of Job shows that counselors can also mislead, even when their theology is evidently orthodox (<a href="?bref=Job.12.17">Job 12:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.26.3">26:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Job’s friends initially joined with Job in his suffering, sitting silently in grief with him for seven days (<a href="?bref=Job.2.11-13">Job 2:11-13</a>). But as soon as they opened their mouths, their consolation ended. Job’s comforters repeatedly elaborated on the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, which was deeply embedded in the covenant (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">Lev 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deut 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.1.31">Prov 1:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.8">22:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.7">Hos 8:7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gal.6.7-8">Gal 6:7-8</a>). We can’t simply reject their words because much of what they said is correct teaching about God’s nature and his ways of working with human beings. However, Job’s friends misapplied this principle (see <a href="?bref=Job.4.8">Job 4:8</a>). They didn’t look at Job’s life, point out where he had sown evil, and then threaten divine judgment. Instead, they ignored Job’s faithful pattern of life, focused on his torment, and concluded that he was reaping the effects of sin. God eventually called these counselors liars, reminding us that right theology must be rightly applied in order to please God and build up others (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.2-4">Prov 15:2-4</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.15.23">23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.25.11">25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.4">Isa 50:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.29">Eph 4:29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">While it is good to weigh advice from various sources, we must compare the counsel of others with what we believe to be right before God (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.20.22">Acts 20:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.4">21:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.21.11">11</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.21.13">13</a>). God might use human counselors to help us define his will, but God himself also guides us through his Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.16.13-15">John 16:13-15</a>). Jesus Christ is our “Wonderful Counselor” (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">Isa 9:6</a>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.28.29">Isa 28:29</a>), who embodies “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (<a href="?bref=Col.2.3">Col 2:3</a>). And when we have opportunities to come alongside others in moments of grief, we must be cautious and tactful in how we apply scriptural principles. Often, our silent presence is the most helpful counsel we can offer.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Afterlife</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Writers in the Old Testament describe the realm of the dead as a place beneath the earth’s surface to which people descend (<a href="?bref=Ezek.26.20">Ezek 26:20</a>). Sometimes they are swallowed alive (<a href="?bref=Num.16.31-33">Num 16:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.55.15">Ps 55:15</a>), but generally they are dragged down by the cords of death (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.4-5">Ps 18:4-5</a>) to be consumed (<a href="?bref=Num.16.30">Num 16:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.24.19">Job 24:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.49.14">Pss 49:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.14">Isa 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.11">14:11</a>).

<title>Job’s Innocence</title>
<refs>Job.27.3-6</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Job’s Innocence</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Job’s comforters could not stomach the idea that any human could be truly innocent (<a href="?bref=Job.4.17-19">Job 4:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.15.14-16">15:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.25.4-6">25:4-6</a>). Job’s claim to innocence also seems to conflict with the biblical teaching that “no one is righteous—not even one. . . . All fall short of God’s glorious standard” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.10">Rom 3:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">23</a>). Was Job right in proclaiming his innocence?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Eliphaz and the others talked right past Job. When they denied that Job could be right or pure, they were referring to the absolute difference between the creature and the Creator. But Job was not claiming absolute purity. He acknowledged his youthful sins (<a href="?bref=Job.13.26">Job 13:26</a>) and was aware of his need to have his sins and his guilt covered (<a href="?bref=Job.14.16-17">14:16-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nonetheless, Job repeatedly claimed to be a man of integrity and innocence in his relationship with God (<a href="?bref=Job.13.14-18">13:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.23.10-12">23:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.27.3-6">27:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.31.1-40">31:1-40</a>). Even Eliphaz acknowledged that Job’s life was upright (<a href="?bref=Job.4.6">4:6</a>). Job’s faith made him doggedly pursue an audience with God and tenaciously believe in God’s justice despite his immediate experience. Job kept looking for his Redeemer (<a href="?bref=Job.19.25">19:25</a>). Although God’s justice might require a mediator (<a href="?bref=Job.9.33-35">9:33-35</a>), and it might not be evident before death (<a href="?bref=Job.19.26">19:26</a>), it guaranteed Job’s acquittal. Job lived “by believing and not by seeing” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.7">2 Cor 5:7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.8.24">Rom 8:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.12">1 Cor 13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.18">2 Cor 4:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-2">Heb 11:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6-8">1 Pet 1:6-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When held up to the light of Christ’s absolute righteousness, Job stands with all of us as a sinner. Job was not justified by his deeds but by his faith, and on that basis God declared that Job was “blameless—a man of complete integrity” (<a href="?bref=Job.1.1">Job 1:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Job.1.8">8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.3">2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.42.7-8">42:7-8</a>). God does the same for us when we, like Job, put our complete trust in him (see <a href="?bref=Rom.4.4-5">Rom 4:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.23">Jas 2:23</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Understanding Job</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">For as long as people have read Job’s story, they have struggled with the tension between the positive and negative aspects of Job’s character. The book’s approval of Job in the opening prologue is unequivocal (<a href="?bref=Job.1.1">1:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Job.1.8">8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.3">2:3</a>), yet we later hear God interrogate Job: “Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorant words?” (<a href="?bref=Job.38.2">38:2</a>). “Will you discredit my justice and condemn me just to prove you are right?” (<a href="?bref=Job.40.8">40:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s questions have led various interpreters to accuse Job of talking too much and even of confusing God’s work with the work of Satan. Some contemporary interpretations side with Job’s counselors in blaming Job for his suffering. Still others follow Eliphaz (<a href="?bref=Job.5.17-27">5:17-27</a>) and Elihu (<a href="?bref=Job.33.15-33">33:15-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.36.7-17">36:7-17</a>) in arguing that Job’s suffering was God’s loving and sanctifying chastisement. Even the faithful are not exempt from such discipline (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.6-12">Heb 12:6-12</a>; see <a href="?bref=Pr.3.11-12">Prov 3:11-12</a>), but this explanation flies in the face of the rationale given in the book’s opening verses.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Job suffered because God wanted to prove Job’s integrity to Satan. God’s own judgment of Job’s life was positive from start to finish (<a href="?bref=Job.1.1">Job 1:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Job.1.8">8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.3">2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.42.7">42:7</a>). This perspective carries through to the New Testament, where Job is an example of endurance that we should imitate (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.11">Jas 5:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Job’s reactions are normal. He does not stand like a rock in reverent stoicism as though he were unaffected by his trials. Neither does he trumpet heroic defiance of his troubles, as though they could never get him down. He reacts in a natural human way. Job rages, protests, moans, and vacillates between confidence and despair, but he never gives up. He does not curse God, and he does not make a false confession of guilt in the hope that God will then let up on him. Although Job cannot understand his situation, he knows that his answer will be found in God (<a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">Job 19:25-27</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Royal Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The <span class="ital">royal psalms</span> all have some reference to the king, the nature of his rule, and his relationship to God. <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Psalms 2</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">18</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.20.1-9">20</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.21.1-13">21</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">45</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.61.1-8">61</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-20">72</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">89</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.101.1-8">101</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-7">110</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.132.1-18">132</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.144.1-15">and 144</a> are usually regarded as the royal psalms.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Belief in God’s kingship is the foundation of the royal psalms (see <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Ps 2</a>). Each king in David’s dynasty served as messianic agent—i.e., he represented God’s kingship. As God’s representative, the Davidic king was expected to uphold the qualities of justice, righteousness, faithfulness, and peace (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-3">72:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The royal psalms express the hope and aspirations of the dynasty of David. But with its corruption and failure, the dynasty came to an apparent end (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.38-45">89:38-45</a>). Yet hope remained alive for the future of a king descended from David who would serve as God’s agent. The royal psalms maintain this hope for a king whose perfect obedience would guarantee the continuity of David’s dynasty and the perpetual benefits of his reign.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In this sense, the royal psalms may also be called <span class="ital">messianic psalms</span> in that they express hope in a messianic agent, an ideal king descended from David. Jesus stated that the psalmists wrote of him (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">Luke 24:44</a>), and other NT writers affirmed the identification of Jesus as the Messiah. Some of the most significant links to Christ are as follows:</p>
<p class="theme-list-sp"><a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Psalm 2</a> is associated with Israel’s king, the descendant of David. Nevertheless, it speaks of a universal vindication and rule that far transcends even David’s or Solomon’s reigns (see <a href="?bref=Acts.13.33">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.5">Heb 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5">5:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list"><a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalm 45</a> is a marriage psalm for one of the Davidic kings, possibly Solomon, yet it speaks of a permanent rule (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.6">45:6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list"><a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-7">Psalm 110</a> is the most frequently quoted messianic psalm (see <a href="?bref=Matt.22.43-45">Matt 22:43-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.34-35">Acts 2:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">Heb 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5-10">5:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.20">6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.21">7:21</a>). It speaks of the privileges, universal victory, and continuing priesthood of David and his successors. Such language would be hyperbole, and possibly misleading, except for its fulfillment in Jesus. In contrast to the angels who are privileged to stand in God’s presence (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.19">Luke 1:19</a>), Christ the Son sits in the place of power and authority over all things at God’s right hand (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">Heb 1:13</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Poor and Needy in the Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout Scripture, God advocates for the poor and needy, who often experience oppression and persecution at the hands of societal structures or the rapacious people around them. The book of Psalms makes numerous references both to the plights of the oppressed and to God’s concern for those experiencing oppression. In their distress, the poor and needy can take refuge in the Lord (see <a href="?bref=Ps.76.9">Ps 76:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.4-9">107:4-9</a>) and cry out to him (see <a href="?bref=Ps.25.16-18">25:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.70.1-5">70:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.74.19">74:19</a>), for he has promised to care for them. They can have faith in him and wait hopefully for him to appear and bring justice (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">18:1-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.70.5">70:5</a>).</p>

<title>Salvation in the Psalms</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Salvation in the Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The psalmists experienced God’s salvation as rescue from evil in the world. They were well acquainted with grief, and in times of affliction, it seemed to them that God had abandoned them. Meanwhile, the wicked took advantage of the apparent injustice to ridicule the godly (<a href="?bref=Ps.3.2">3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.71.10-11">71:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalmists cried out for rescue, knowing that they were completely dependent on the Lord (<a href="?bref=Ps.31.15">31:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.17">35:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.13">69:13</a>). While waiting for rescue, the psalmists had faith that the Lord was with them, keeping guard over them (<a href="?bref=Ps.46.1-11">Pss 46</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.121.1-8">121</a>), and would not abandon them (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.14">94:14</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.7.10">7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.31.2">31:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.62.6-7">62:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.2">144:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God graciously rescues his needy servants and answers their prayers (<a href="?bref=Ps.20.6">20:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.28.8">28:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.6">34:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.34.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-2">40:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.76.9">76:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.1-43">107</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.145.19">145:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.4">149:4</a>). When the Lord rescues his people, he receives glory through their thanksgiving, praise, and testimony (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.15">50:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.79.9">79:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.85.9">85:9</a>). God’s mighty acts are recorded in Scripture so that his people will praise him for what he has done and trust him to rescue them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalms encourage the godly to identify themselves with these stories of salvation. For example, in <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">Psalm 18</a> the psalmist describes his anguish, his lament, and the Lord’s salvation (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.17">18:17</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.19">19</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.20">20</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.43">43</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.48">48</a>) in such a manner that all the humble are invited to look to the Lord in hope (see <a href="?bref=Ps.72.12">72:12</a>). The Lord has rescued his people throughout history, and the Lord will save his people again.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Salvation excludes the wicked (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.27">69:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.155">119:155</a>), who ridicule those who hope in the Lord’s rescue (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.8">22:8</a>). The wicked may call to the Lord in their hour of judgment, but he will not rescue them (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.27">18:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.50.22">50:22</a>). Hope in God’s salvation requires a life of faith (<a href="?bref=Ps.119.123">119:123</a>) and love of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Ps.60.5">60:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.108.6">108:6</a>). Such faith casts out fear (<a href="?bref=Ps.34.4">34:4</a>), knowing that the Lord does what is right (<a href="?bref=Ps.71.2">71:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord Jesus came to save sinners. He ministered to the needy and the marginalized, bringing physical deliverance to many; and he died under oppression, bringing spiritual deliverance to the world. He rescues people from themselves, from Satan, from death, and from adversity. He has the power to vindicate the faithful, judge sinners, and completely save all of God’s children. He will renew all things, while excluding the wicked from his everlasting salvation.</p>

<title>Psalms of Suffering</title>
<refs>Ps.22.1-31</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Psalms of Suffering</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The four psalms of suffering (also called “Passion Psalms”; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">Pss 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-36">69</a>) address the deep distress experienced by God’s servant.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a> has perhaps the most remarkable language of the psalms of suffering. In this psalm, God’s servant suffers though he is righteous. There is no suggestion of any sin, so the psalmist’s suffering appears completely unjustified. Despite bitter persecution, there is no prayer for vengeance (see <a href="?bref=Ps.137.1-9">Ps 137</a>). This psalm has some noteworthy connections with the crucifixion of Christ (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.22.6-8">Ps 22:6-8</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.22.14-18">14-18</a>). In fact, Jesus recited part of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a> when he was on the cross (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.1">22:1</a>; see <a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Matt 27:46</a>). The sinless Christ even prayed for his executioners (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.34">Luke 23:34</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The other psalms of suffering also came to be associated with Christ. <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Psalm 16:10</a> anticipates Christ’s triumph over death (cp. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.24-31">Acts 2:24-31</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.40.6-8">Psalm 40:6-8</a> foreshadows the self-giving, redemptive work of Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.5-10">Heb 10:5-10</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-36">Psalm 69</a> refers to isolation as resulting from commitment to God’s cause (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.8-9">69:8-9</a>). It also anticipates the part Judas played in what was fundamentally God’s work in Christ (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.25-26">69:25-26</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.109.8">Ps 109:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.53.10">Isa 53:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.20">Acts 1:20</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Shepherd</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the Jewish economy, the shepherd who tended a flock of sheep or goats held a position of importance. Shepherding was fundamental to ancient Near Eastern society. The shepherd’s task was to lead the flock out of the fold each morning (<a href="?bref=John.10.2-4">John 10:2-4</a>), to find grass and water for the flock, to protect them from wild animals (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.12">Amos 3:12</a>), to look for and restore those that strayed (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.8">Ezek 34:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.12">Matt 18:12</a>), and to return the flock to the fold every evening.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The word <span class="ital">shepherd</span> became a common term for a ruler. The kings of Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt were often referred to as shepherds who protected their people. This metaphorical use is also prevalent in the Old Testament (<a href="?bref=Num.27.17">Num 27:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.17">1 Kgs 22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.21">Jer 10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.1-2">23:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.1-10">Ezek 34:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, God is pictured as the Shepherd of Israel, concerned for every aspect of his people’s welfare (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.24">Gen 49:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1">Pss 23:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1">80:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.11">Isa 40:11</a>). God himself would provide for his flock (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.3">Jer 23:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.10">31:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.11-22">Ezek 34:11-22</a>), and he promised to provide faithful shepherds who showed concern for his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.15">Jer 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.4">23:4</a>). When Israel’s early leaders proved to be unfaithful shepherds, God intervened and appointed his servant David as a faithful shepherd to lead them. He later promised that he would establish David’s offspring as shepherd over them (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.23-24">Ezek 34:23-24</a>). By the time of the prophet Jeremiah, <span class="ital">shepherd</span> began to be used with reference to the coming Messiah.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the New Testament, Jesus referred to himself as the Shepherd (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-33">Matt 25:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.27">Mark 14:27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.1-30">John 10:1-30</a>). He is the Good Shepherd who gives his life for the sheep (<a href="?bref=John.10.11-18">John 10:11-18</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20">Heb 13:20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The leaders of the church are also called shepherds (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>, translated “pastors”)—God gives them to the church to care for his people as a shepherd does their sheep, leading and teaching them in the ways of God. They are to be faithful shepherds until the Chief Shepherd, Jesus Christ, appears to lead his people directly (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-4">1 Pet 5:1-4</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Presence in the Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Scripture writers often express the desire to experience God’s presence. In the intimate experience of his presence, God’s rich goodness and love are all that people need (see <a href="?bref=Ps.21.6">Ps 21:6</a>). By the same token, the absence of God’s presence is distressing and damaging.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The poets of Israel often spoke of God’s face as a way of expressing his presence or absence. So they sought his face (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.6">24:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.4">105:4</a>). When his face shone or was turned toward his people, they experienced his presence in blessing, provision, and protection (<a href="?bref=Ps.67.1">67:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.3-19">80:3-19</a>). God’s hiding his face from his people was a picture of divine abandonment (<a href="?bref=Ps.13.1">13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.27.9">27:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.24">44:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.17">69:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.14">88:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.46">89:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.102.2">102:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.29">104:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.143.7">143:7</a>), as if God were not seeing or hearing them (<a href="?bref=Ps.10.11">10:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.42.3">42:3</a>). The absence of God creates dismay, shame, and chaos, and may even lead to death (<a href="?bref=Ps.30.7">30:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.24">44:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.29">104:29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalmists prayed for God’s presence as they requested a change in their circumstances (<a href="?bref=Ps.31.15-16">31:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.67.1">67:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.17">69:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.3">80:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.80.7">7</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.80.19">19</a>), and they acknowledged the role of his presence in giving them aid (see <a href="?bref=Ps.44.3">44:3</a>). The godly long to be invited into God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Ps.11.7">11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.9-11">16:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.17.15">17:15</a>). His presence alone satisfies their deepest longing (<a href="?bref=Ps.17.15">17:15</a>) and gives them lasting pleasure (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.4">37:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.43.4">43:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.25">73:25</a>). Everything about God delights them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s favor and goodness are realized in his presence (<a href="?bref=Ps.23.6">23:6</a>), as demonstrated in his people’s experiences of blessing, abundant crops, and prosperity (<a href="?bref=Ps.21.3">21:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.65.11">65:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.10">68:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.85.12">85:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.5">106:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.128.2">128:2</a>). Thus God’s goodness and the Temple—the place where his presence is especially manifest—are closely linked (<a href="?bref=Ps.65.4">65:4</a>). God’s presence leads to health and vitality among his people, and he satisfies his people who are in need (<a href="?bref=Ps.107.9">107:9</a>).

<p class="theme-title">Wisdom Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Some psalms are called wisdom psalms because they make a case for the primary importance of wisdom or instruct readers in dealing with questions, issues, and doubts that arise in life (see <a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-6">Pss 1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.14.1-7">14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.25.1-22">25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.37.1-40">37</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.39.1-13">39</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.49.1-20">49</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-28">73</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">78</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-17">90</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.91.1-16">91</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.111.1-10">111</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1-10">112</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.127.1-5">127</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.128.1-6">128</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.131.1-3">131</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.133.1-3">133</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-24">139</a>). Many other psalms contain elements of wisdom teaching (see <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">Pss 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.27.1-14">27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.31.1-24">31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.62.1-12">62</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.92.1-15">92</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.1-23">94</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.1-43">107</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.1-15">144</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.146.1-10">146</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the other nations of the ancient Near East, wisdom had to do with maintaining order, pleasing the gods and other people, and carefully observing life, society, and nature. In Israel, wisdom shares these concerns but is distinct in the centrality it gives to fear of the Lord. God alone is the center and focus of life, and proper fear of him opens the path of wisdom (<a href="?bref=Ps.111.10">111:10</a>). Fear of the Lord is a disposition of absolute submission to and trust in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Ps.115.11">115:11</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.40.3">40:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.7">112:7</a>), which leads to purity of life (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.9">19:9</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">Psalm 34</a> connects the fear of the Lord with abundant life.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The way of wisdom is the way of godliness. <a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-6">Psalm 1</a> invites all readers of the psalms to delight in God, his revelation, and the lifestyle that results from his care for the wise. The lives of the godly demonstrate inner consistency, growth, and beauty as they increasingly reflect God’s righteousness and justice, love and fidelity, compassion and grace. They practice godliness from the inside out.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Wisdom enlarges a person’s perspective on life. A wise person desires to see life from God’s point of view. This search means living in submission and trust under the sovereign King who maintains the order and harmony of creation. Seeking God encourages an orderly and peaceful life and motivates obedience (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.7">19:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.25.12">25:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.6">51:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1">112:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.98-100">119:98-100</a>). The wise imitate God, and their lives are full of joy even when they are suffering hardship. They praise the Lord amid all circumstances of life (see <a href="?bref=Ps.22.23">22:23</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.22.25">25</a>), and they face life confidently because the Lord is with them (<a href="?bref=Ps.23.4">23:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.27.1">27:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.27.3">3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.18">33:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.91.1-16">91:1-16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In contrast to the way of the wise is the way of the fool, or the wicked. Such people perceive themselves as powerful and continually boast of their accomplishments. They do not accept limitations. They brag, oppress, steal, and deprive others of their happiness. They have no fear of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Ps.36.1">36:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.55.19">55:19</a>). The poets of Israel repeatedly warned the people to be wary of the path of folly, lest God’s judgment overtake them (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.10-11">2:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.8-10">94:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus Christ came into the world as God in the flesh, and he embodies all the qualities of wisdom. Through him, we can walk in the way of wisdom (<a href="?bref=Col.2.2-3">Col 2:2-3</a>).</p>

<title>Questions and Doubt</title>
<refs>Ps.42.1-43.5</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Questions and Doubt</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The psalmists are not afraid to ask questions and express doubts. The number of questions in a psalm indicates the intensity of the mood or the significance of the issue at hand. The psalms with the greatest number of questions raise the important issues of God’s perceived abandonment (<a href="?bref=Ps.13.1-6">Ps 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-43.5">Pss 42–43</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.74.1-23">74</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">89</a>) and the prosperity of the wicked (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-28">Ps 73</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalmists’ questions clarify life issues. Some questions ask whether the Lord is the true God (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.9-10">94:9-10</a>) and why he seems to have abandoned the godly (<a href="?bref=Ps.77.7">77:7</a>). Other questions call attention to the success of the wicked (<a href="?bref=Ps.10.13">10:13</a>), the impotence of the godly (<a href="?bref=Ps.11.3">11:3</a>), the election of Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.68.16">68:16</a>), the power of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.114.5-6">114:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.147.17">147:17</a>), the folly of the nations (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.1">2:1</a>), and the issue of injustice (<a href="?bref=Ps.82.2">82:2</a>). The psalmists question, examine, challenge, doubt, and occasionally despair over God’s seeming lack of concern.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalmists’ questions may also lead to praise and worship: “Who can list the glorious miracles of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>? Who can ever praise him enough?” (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.2">106:2</a>). The question, “Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel?” (<a href="?bref=Ps.53.6">53:6</a>) calls attention to the answer: The Lord rescues his people. For many questions, the implied answer brings praise to the Lord: “Whom have I in heaven but you? I desire you more than anything on earth” (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.25">73:25</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.89.8">89:8</a>). Questions may also express wonder at God’s grace (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.4">8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.130.3">130:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.3">144:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Asking good questions can be the beginning of a dialogue with the Lord that leads us along the path of wisdom and results in worship and praise.</p>

<title>Zion</title>
<refs>Isa.60.1-22</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Zion</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Zion is the Hebrew name for the mountain in Jerusalem where the Temple was located (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.7">2 Sam 5:7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.1">2 Chr 3:1</a>). Zion is used as a synonym for Jerusalem, and the NLT often translates <span class="ital">Zion</span> as “Jerusalem” (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.69.35">Pss 69:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.87.2">87:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.8">97:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.13">132:13</a>). Thus Zion can refer to the actual, physical city of Jerusalem that was destroyed in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> (see <a href="?bref=Ps.102.13">102:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.126.1">126:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.137.1">137:1</a>) and again in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Zion also signifies the city of God that transcends geographical location. Zion is God’s universal kingdom, the city in which he dwells (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.2">74:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">76:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.84.7">84:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.21">135:21</a>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.26.1-21">Isa 26</a>). This city embodies trust, justice, righteousness, and commitment, for the Lord does not tolerate impurity, uncleanness, idolatry, injustice, or unrighteousness (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.21-28">Isa 1:21-28</a>). The prophets and poets of Israel speak of the city of God as being more extensive than the physical city. The citizens of this city come from Judah, Israel, and the nations (see <a href="?bref=Ps.87.5-6">Ps 87:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.22-24">Heb 12:22-24</a>). Zion is on a high mountain (<a href="?bref=Ps.48.2">Ps 48:2</a>) at the center of God’s kingdom on earth (<a href="?bref=Ps.99.2">99:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.13">132:13</a>), and God’s throne is there (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.11">9:11</a>). Therefore, godly prayers and praise focus on Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.53.6">53:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.65.1">65:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.147.12">147:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.2">149:2</a>), and redemption is sought there (<a href="?bref=Ps.14.7">14:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.20.2">20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.50.2">50:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.53.6">53:6</a>). David’s descendants are the legitimate heirs who rule over Zion to establish God’s universal kingdom (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.6">2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.110.2">110:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Zion is symbolic of God’s protection and blessings (<a href="?bref=Ps.46.4-11">Pss 46:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-14">48:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.18">51:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.128.5">128:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.134.3">134:3</a>). Anyone who trusts in the Lord is as secure as Mount Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.125.1">125:1</a>), but those who reject the Lord also reject the security of Zion and have no future (<a href="?bref=Ps.129.5-8">129:5-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament speaks of Mount Zion as a heavenly Jerusalem, the spiritual home of those from all nations who have been reborn through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.22-24">Heb 12:22-24</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gal.4.24-26">Gal 4:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">Rev 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2-4">21:2-4</a>). Abraham looked forward in faith to “a city with eternal foundations” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.10">Heb 11:10</a>), a city in which all men and women of faith are citizens (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.22-24">Heb 12:22-24</a>). Because the Lord knows no geographical limitations (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>), the true Zion he inhabits is the hearts of all who worship him.</p>

<refs>Ps.71.22-23</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Music in Ancient Israel</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The earliest nomadic peoples made music. The first musician mentioned in the Bible is “Jubal, the first of all who play the harp and flute” (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.21">Gen 4:21</a>). Music was significant from the beginning of Israel’s worship in the Tabernacle. In <a href="?bref=Exod.28.34-35">Exodus 28:34-35</a>, Aaron’s robe is described as having bells attached to the lower hem that sounded as he entered the Holy Place. Scripture records several songs created by the people of God (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-21">Exod 15:1-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31:30-32.44">Deut 31:30–32:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Judg 5:1-31</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The first liturgical music mentioned in the Old Testament is in the narrative of the transfer of the Ark—David and the Israelites sang, played instruments, and danced to the glory of the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sam 6:5</a>). David is recognized as making the musical instruments used in the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.7.6">2 Chr 7:6</a>). In the postexilic era, the Levitical singers that are mentioned were the descendants of Asaph, the chief musician appointed by David (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.41">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.44">Neh 7:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.22-23">11:22-23</a>). In short, Israel’s liturgical music and organization originated in the time of David.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The stately ceremony of the later services in Solomon’s Temple contrasts with the enthusiasm and spontaneity of David’s worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.7.1-6">2 Chr 7:1-6</a>). Singers and musicians for worship at the Temple were chosen from the tribe of Levi (<a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1">1 Chr 25:1</a>, <a href="?bref=1Chr.25.7">7</a>). They rotated their participation in the weekday, Sabbath, and high holy day services.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Anger</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Lord is just and righteous in his judgment (<a href="?bref=Ps.7.11">Ps 7:11</a>), and he experiences anger at sin and injustice. The wicked stir up his anger and deserve his judgment (see <a href="?bref=Ps.2.5">2:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.2.12">12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.21.9">21:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.56.7">56:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.59.13">59:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.24">69:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.79.6">79:6</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18">Rom 1:18</a>). And while he is patient and slow to anger (<a href="?bref=Ps.86.15">86:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.8">103:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.145.8">145:8</a>), he ultimately will not allow evil to remain unchecked.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalmists understood Israel’s exodus from Egypt as an object lesson about God’s anger. God expressed his anger against the Egyptians while sparing his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.49-50">Ps 78:49-50</a>). But Israel itself became the object of God’s anger during the wilderness journey, when the people provoked the Lord through their rebelliousness (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.31">78:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.29">106:29</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.106.32">32</a>). As a result, God took an oath: That rebellious generation would not enter his place of rest (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.8-11">95:8-11</a>). So they died in the wilderness. But he restrained his anger and did not destroy Israel as they deserved (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.38">78:38</a>). Similarly, throughout the period of the judges and the monarchy, God’s people were marked by disobedience and evil; subsequently, in his wrath, God allowed them to be controlled by foreign powers, who sent them into exile (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.20-25.21">24:20–25:21</a>). But again, God did not allow his people to be completely destroyed.</p>
<p class="theme-body">When God’s people sin and experience his anger, it can precipitate repentance, in which case the experience, though painful, can lead to great joy in God’s mercy and goodness (<a href="?bref=Ps.30.5">Ps 30:5</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-11">Heb 12:5-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament makes clear that all of humanity was subject to God’s wrath on account of sin (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.1-3">Eph 2:1-3</a>). But in his love, God sent his son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins and reconcile us to God (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.6-11">Rom 5:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4-5">Eph 2:4-5</a>). Those who turn to God in faith will thus escape the punishment that is coming at the future judgment of the world. In the end, Jesus will serve as the agent of God’s anger against the wicked (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.5-9">Pss 2:5-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.15-17">Rev 6:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-16">19:11-16</a>), who—along with God’s ultimate enemy, the devil—will be dealt with decisively (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-15">Rev 20:7-15</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Making Sense of the Exile</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Israel’s kings and the people of Israel repeatedly rebelled against God and broke their covenant with him. God therefore declared that he would bring the curses of the covenant upon them (see <a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">Deut 28:15-68</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Jer.4.13">Jer 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.11">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.14-15">Mic 6:14-15</a>). God sent the Assyrian and Babylonian armies to execute this sentence, and a large number of the Israelites were taken into exile (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-25.21">2 Kgs 24:1–25:21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Exile shaped many of the psalms; we see its impact working behind the scenes in various images and themes. In <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">Psalm 89</a> the grief, anguish, and confusion of the Exile are distilled into several questions that the psalmist raises: Has God abandoned David’s royal line (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.38-39">89:38-39</a>)? How long will God’s anger last (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.46">Ps 89:46</a>)? Does God understand human frailty (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.47-48">89:47-48</a>)? Is God true to his nature (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.49">89:49</a>)? Is God just in not avenging his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.50-51">89:50-51</a>)?</p>
<p class="theme-body">These questions were on the minds of God’s people during and after the Exile. Some of their doubts raise questions concerning God’s ability to rule. Rather than dismissing these questions, wise readers listen, reflect, and study the answers that Scripture gives.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The definitive answer came in the Lord Jesus Christ (see <a href="?bref=Isa.52.1-54.17">Isa 52–54</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Luke 1:46-55</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.1.67-79">67-79</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-19">4:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.6">Rom 6:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.6.16-23">16-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.22-24">Heb 12:22-24</a>). But those who experienced the Exile could only dimly foresee a hopeful future. They asked these hard questions and lived without clear answers.</p>

<p class="theme-body">There is a darkness surrounding God (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.21">Exod 20:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.11">Deut 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.23">5:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.22.12">2 Sam 22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.11">Ps 18:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.2">97:2</a>); he dwells in thick darkness (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.12">1 Kgs 8:12</a> <span class="ital">//</span> <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.1">2 Chr 6:1</a>), and thick darkness is under his feet (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.10">2 Sam 22:10</a> <span class="ital">//</span> <a href="?bref=Ps.18.9">Ps 18:9</a>). God is unknowable unless he reveals himself.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Darkness often stands for distress and anxiety, or for the confusion and destruction experienced by the wicked (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.12">Gen 15:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.12.25">Job 12:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.6">Pss 35:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.10">107:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.107.14">14</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.5.17">Eccl 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.30">Isa 5:30</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">For Job, darkness was like nothingness (<a href="?bref=Job.3.4-6">Job 3:4-6</a>). It points to death, a land of shadows and gloom, the dwelling place of the dead far from the light of day (<a href="?bref=Job.10.21-22">Job 10:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.17.12-13">17:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.6.4">Eccl 6:4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Evil takes place under the cover of darkness (<a href="?bref=Job.24.16-17">Job 24:16-17</a>), but darkness cannot be a hiding place from God (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.11-12">Ps 139:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.29.15-16">Isa 29:15-16</a>). Darkness often depicts ignorance of God’s will: Knowledge of God is “light,” so lack of knowledge is “darkness” (<a href="?bref=Job.12.24-25">Job 12:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.4.16">Matt 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.5">John 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.35">12:35</a>, <a href="?bref=John.12.46">46</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5">1 Jn 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.8-9">2:8-9</a>, <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.11">11</a>).

In the New Testament, darkness is also a metaphor for spiritual ignorance (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.16">Matt 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.23">6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.79">Luke 1:79</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.35">11:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.19">Rom 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.13">Col 1:13</a>). Those who come to know God come out of darkness (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.2">Isa 9:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">A major theme of the Old Testament prophets was the Day of the Lord, which was often associated with darkness (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.8">Ezek 32:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.2">Joel 2:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Joel.2.31">31</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18">Amos 5:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Amos.5.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.15">Zeph 1:15</a>).

<p class="theme-h2">Light</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Light was the first thing God created after the heavens and earth (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.3">Gen 1:3</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gen.1.16">1:16</a>). It is a natural symbol for what is pleasant, good, or uplifting (<a href="?bref=Eccl.11.7">Eccl 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.17">Jas 1:17</a>). When the Israelites left Egypt, they were led by a pillar of cloud and fire that gave them light (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">Exod 13:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.14.20">14:20</a>) and showed them the way to go (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.19">Neh 9:19</a>). Light symbolizes the blessing of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Job.12.22">Job 12:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.29.2-3">29:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.4.6">Pss 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.28">18:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.3">44:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.118.27">118:27</a>). God’s servants can extend this blessing by being a light to guide others (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.6">Isa 42:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">49:6</a>). God’s light also exposes sin and brings justice (see <a href="?bref=Ps.90.8">Ps 90:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.4">Isa 51:4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God himself is described as light (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.1">Ps 27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.19-20">Isa 60:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.22">Dan 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5">1 Jn 1:5</a>), and he dwells in unapproachable light (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.16">1 Tim 6:16</a>). Yet he brings his servants into the light (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.8-9">Mic 7:8-9</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus said, “I am the light of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">John 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.5">9:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.46">12:46</a>). He brought a revelation (light) from God, but he was more than a revealer—he was himself that revelation (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-10">John 1:1-10</a>). Those who receive Jesus, who believe in the Light, receive the right to become children of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.9-12">John 1:9-12</a>). They are illumined by his light and come to know God and his salvation (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.16">Matt 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.32">Luke 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.47">Acts 13:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.18">26:18</a>). They are “children of the light” (<a href="?bref=John.12.36">John 12:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.5">1 Thes 5:5</a>), their allegiance is to the light (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>), and their conduct is characterized by light—by “what is good and right and true” (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.8-9">Eph 5:8-9</a>).</p>

<title>Praise Psalms</title>
<refs>Ps.9.1-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Praise Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Hebrew title of the book of Psalms means “Praises,” and that title accurately defines a large number of the psalms. God is praised throughout the psalms for his nature and for his great acts in creation and history. Praise psalms were written for individual use and for the community.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="ital">Individual praise</span> (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.1-20">Pss 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.116.1-19">116</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.138.1-8">138</a>). It was customary in Temple worship for people to give verbal thanks in front of the whole assembly whenever they made a vow offering or a thank offering (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.22.22-26">22:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.66.13-20">66:13-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.116.17-19">116:17-19</a>). Such opportunities for personal praise and testimony must have added warmth and significance to worship. Each act of rescue and every experience of God’s mercy became part of the cumulative, ongoing story of salvation. Worship was not simply a recital of God’s deeds in earlier centuries.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="ital">Communal praise</span> (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-22">Pss 103</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-9">113</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.124.1-8">124</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.129.1-8">129</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">136</a>). When the community gathered, they praised the Lord in song for his acts in history (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-22">Ps 103</a>) or for a specific recent manifestation of his mercy (<a href="?bref=Ps.124.1-8">Pss 124</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.129.1-8">129</a>). In <a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-22">Psalm 103</a>, the psalmist praises God for his mercy to each individual (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-5">103:1-5</a>) and to the whole community (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.6-14">103:6-14</a>). The frailty of humanity contrasts with God’s constancy (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.15-18">103:15-18</a>); his universal and absolute rule merits universal praise (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.19-22">103:19-22</a>).</p>

<title>Prayers for Vengeance</title>
<refs>Ps.3.7</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Prayers for Vengeance</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The psalmists sometimes asked the Lord to execute vengeance against their adversaries. It was not unusual for a psalmist to pray for the violent destruction of their enemies as a manifestation of God’s justice. How can this kind of prayer be okay?</p>
<p class="theme-body">These prayers for the destruction of the wicked arose out of concern for justice and righteousness and out of confidence in God. Divine justice is defined in <a href="?bref=Ps.1.6">Psalm 1:6</a>: The Lord loves the righteous and destroys the wicked. The wicked are subversive, corrupt, and thoroughly committed to evil; they live in opposition to God and to everything that God does. The wicked shake the foundations of ethics, of society, and of God’s kingdom. The psalmists argued that evil is inconsistent with God’s nature and that the removal of evil is the only way for his kingdom to thrive. However, the poets of Israel did not simply invoke God’s judgment on anyone with whom they could not get along. Instead, the psalmists were guided by God’s standards of justice and righteousness, to which God holds all humans accountable.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The psalmists were intimately acquainted with grief. They had suffered and been oppressed and marginalized by bullies, leaders, and kings from inside and outside of Israel. Their prayers were full of faith and hope, asking how long the Lord would tolerate their suffering and confessing that the Lord alone could rescue them from evil. They expressed deep longing for his redemption. By the principle of retribution, they asked the Lord to inflict upon the wicked the suffering that they had endured (<a href="?bref=Ps.5.10">Ps 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.6.10">6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.9.19-20">9:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.28.4">28:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.56.7">56:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.35">104:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.137.7-9">137:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.139.19">139:19</a>). Through these prayers for justice and vindication, the godly may rest in peace as they await God’s rescue.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Do we truly see evil as evil, or do we perceive it merely as an inconvenience? Prayers for the end of evil are appropriate as long as we recognize God as arbiter, judge, and executor. The prayer for the coming of God’s Kingdom implies the removal of evil. But now the cruelty inflicted on the wicked has been transformed through the cruel crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This act of God informs how we pray for those who oppose us. Jesus will indeed judge and bring an ultimate end to evil (see <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-21">Rev 19:11-21</a>), but while Christians await that final judgment, they are to love as Christ loved (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">John 13:34</a>), pray for their enemies, and forgive them (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.38-48">Matt 5:38-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.13">Col 3:13</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Heart in the Psalms</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Hebrew words <span class="hebrew">leb</span> and <span class="hebrew">lebab</span> (both meaning “heart”) are hard to translate because they rarely refer to the physical human heart. Rather, these terms usually refer to the center of one’s being, an image for a person’s thought life, reflections, and will. The story of the heart reveals a person’s commitment and direction in life.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The hearts of the wicked are cunning and scheming (<a href="?bref=Ps.58.2">Ps 58:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.64.6">64:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.140.2">140:2</a>).

The wicked are only committed to themselves (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.37">78:37</a>), and their destructive way of life (<a href="?bref=Ps.5.9">5:9</a>) leads to their own destruction.</p>

<title>Fear of the Lord</title>
<refs>Pr.1.7</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Fear of the Lord</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As Moses is giving final instructions to the people of Israel prior to his death, he exhorts the people several times to “fear the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.6.1-13">Deut 6:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.12-21">10:12-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31.9-13">31:9-13</a>). Joshua gives the same directive near the end of his life (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.14">Josh 24:14</a>). <span class="ital">Fear</span> implies respect, awe, and at times, knee-knocking terror. Fear of the Lord encompasses a continual attentiveness to his sovereignty and power. For the Israelites to fear the Lord, it would mean an acknowledgment that everything needed for success comes from total dependence on God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The main theme of Proverbs can be summed up in the ten words that appear near the beginning of the book: “Fear of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is the foundation of true knowledge” (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">Prov 1:7</a>). The fear of the Lord leads people toward humility and away from pride (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.7">3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.33">15:33</a>). With such an attitude, people are more apt to listen to God than to their own independent judgment. Fear of the Lord recognizes God’s central place in the order of the world. God is the Creator and Master of all things. This is why <a href="?bref=Ps.14.1">Psalm 14:1</a> labels those who reject God as “fools”. Those who fear the Lord receive wisdom because they begin to understand that everything is under God’s rule and in his service. This is more than just an attitude; it is a way of living that takes into account God’s power and authority and our ultimate accountability to him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Wisdom is closely connected to a proper relationship with God—both require choices in line with God’s character (see <a href="?bref=Job.28.28">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.14.2">Prov 14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.13">Eccl 12:13</a>). Do you want wisdom? Then you must enter into a relationship with the one who has all wisdom (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-2.16">1 Cor 1:1–2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.3">Col 2:3</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Wisdom</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Wisdom helps us know how to speak and act in different situations. It provides the ability to avoid problems as well as the skill to handle them when they arise. Wisdom goes beyond simple intelligence. Proverbs notes that even animals such as ants, hyraxes, locusts, and lizards (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.24-28">Prov 30:24-28</a>) are wise. This is not because they have great intelligence but because they know how to navigate life skillfully.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The foundation of wisdom is God himself. No wisdom exists apart from fear of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">1:7</a>). Wisdom is closely connected to righteousness and remains distant from evil. According to Proverbs, wisdom is gained through observation and experience (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.6-8">6:6-8</a>), from instruction based on tradition (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.17-21">22:17-21</a>), in learning from mistakes (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.1">12:1</a>), and finally, but most importantly, through divine revelation (see <a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-2.16">1 Corinthians 1–2</a>, Paul contrasts the “wisdom” of the world (which he calls foolishness) with the wisdom of Christ. Paul also says of Jesus, “In him lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (<a href="?bref=Col.2.3">Col 2:3</a>). The wisdom that comes from God is evidenced in the lives of believers by their goodness, humility, purity, and peace (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.13-18">Jas 3:13-18</a>).</p>

<title>Marriage and Sexuality</title>
<refs>Pr.2.16-22</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Marriage and Sexuality</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">From the beginning of Scripture, marriage is considered sacred, and appropriate sexual expression is an important part of marriage (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.23-25">Gen 2:23-25</a>). The Fall created a rupture in all relationships, first between God and humans, and then between husband and wife (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gen 3</a>). The division between Adam and Eve was expressed in terms of their sexuality; they could no longer stand naked in the garden without feeling shame.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Proverbs, the wise teacher frequently warns naive young men to avoid the temptations of sexual expression outside of marriage (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.16-22">Prov 2:16-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.5.1-23">5:1-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.20-7.27">6:20–7:27</a>). While a young man might find other women physically attractive and seductive, the consequences of acting on these temptations are dire: His family and professional aspirations might be destroyed. Proverbs teaches young men to cultivate a strong relationship with their own wives. They are counseled to have healthy marital sex rather than sleeping with other women (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.15-20">5:15-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although this section of Proverbs was originally written to instruct young men, all readers can reflect on these issues of marriage and sexuality. Proverbs urges men and women to recognize the sanctity and beauty of marital love as God, the wise Creator, intended it.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament reaffirms the sacredness of sexuality and its proper expression in marriage. Jesus appeals to the creation narrative in Genesis as a way of highlighting the intended permanency of the marriage relationship. After quoting <a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Genesis 2:24</a>, he states, “Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.3-6">Matt 19:3-6</a>). Paul discusses the importance of maintaining sexual intimacy in marriage, lest Satan be afforded an opportunity to tempt (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.3-5">1 Cor 7:3-5</a>). God’s desire is that those who join in marriage would remain faithful to one another, avoiding sexual activity that is destructive to the sacred relationship they have entered (see <a href="?bref=Heb.13.4">Heb 13:4</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Speaking</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As children we probably heard, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” Scripture presents another viewpoint: Words have the power of life and death (<a href="?bref=Pr.18.21">18:21</a>). The words contained in lies (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.5">14:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.14.25">25</a>), arguments (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.17">26:17</a>), insults (<a href="?bref=Pr.20.20">20:20</a>), slander (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.18">10:18</a>), gossip (<a href="?bref=Pr.11.13">11:13</a>), rumors (<a href="?bref=Pr.18.8">18:8</a>), flattery (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.21-22">7:21-22</a>), and bragging (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.23">26:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.2">27:2</a>) can all be death-dealing.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Proverbs repeatedly emphasizes that foolish people speak foolish words. They are represented by “the woman named Folly” (<a href="?bref=Pr.9.13-18">9:13-18</a>), who lies and deceives to harm her hearers. Words reflect the condition of the heart (<a href="?bref=Pr.16.23">16:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.4">18:4</a>). While someone might conceal an evil heart by using pleasant words (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.23">26:23</a>), a person’s true character will eventually surface (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.24-26">26:24-26</a>). The words of fools not only harm others; these words ultimately injure those who speak them. The tongue is full of wickedness that can ruin your whole life (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.6">Jas 3:6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In contrast, wise people speak the life-giving words represented by Wisdom (<a href="?bref=Pr.8.7-9">Prov 8:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.11">10:11</a>). Wise people use their words sparingly (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.27-28">17:27-28</a>) and are usually gentle (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.4">15:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.24">16:24</a>). However, a wise person also knows the right time to speak (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.23">15:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.25.11">25:11</a>) and realizes that, at times, even harsh criticism is necessary (see <a href="?bref=Pr.27.5">27:5</a>). Proverbs wisely reminds its readers to pay close attention not only to what they say but also to how and when they say it.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Anger</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Wise people do not fly off the handle in anger. “People with understanding control their anger; a hot temper shows great foolishness” (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.29">Prov 14:29</a>). Because anger can cloud judgment, it is vitally important for the wise to reflect on their actions before responding (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.16">14:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although the book of Proverbs comments on anger only in a negative light, Scripture does not portray all anger as bad. Many psalms express anger (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.77.1-20">Ps 77</a>), and Jesus became angry as he threw the money changers out of the Temple (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.15-17">Mark 11:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.13-16">John 2:13-16</a>). People must learn to distinguish righteous anger from unrighteous anger, though it is often hard to tell the two apart. Unrighteous anger is only concerned to protect or promote oneself (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-8">Gen 4:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.8-9">1 Sam 18:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.3-4">1 Kgs 21:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.11">2 Kgs 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.10">2 Chr 25:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.4.1-11">Jon 4</a>). Righteous anger reflects God’s hatred of evil and love of justice (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Exod 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.1">Num 11:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.11.10">10</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Nah.1.3">Nah 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.22">Rom 9:22</a>). The wise person reads the circumstances and discerns whether and to what degree to express anger (see also <a href="?bref=Pr.22.24">Prov 22:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.9">Eccl 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.22">Matt 5:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.19">Rom 12:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.26-27">Eph 4:26-27</a>, <a href="?bref=Eph.4.31">31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.19-20">Jas 1:19-20</a>).</p>

<title>Wealth and Poverty in the Wisdom Literature</title>
<refs>Pr.16.8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Wealth and Poverty in the Wisdom Literature</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The sayings in Scripture about wealth and poverty, particularly in the wisdom literature, are individual snapshots of a broad truth: God blesses the wise with wealth (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.9-10">3:9-10</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.3.15-16">15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.22">10:22</a>), making life’s difficulties more manageable (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.15">10:15</a>), while foolish behavior—especially laziness—leads to poverty (see <a href="?bref=Pr.10.4">10:4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Proverbs readily acknowledges that some wicked fools are wealthy, but it also reminds us that this kind of wealth will not last long (<a href="?bref=Pr.11.18">11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.13.11">13:11</a>). Poverty can sometimes result from injustice (<a href="?bref=Pr.13.23">13:23</a>) rather than foolishness, and wealth sometimes comes from injustice and dishonesty (<a href="?bref=Pr.16.8">16:8</a>). Those who have wealth need to use it wisely, which includes generosity to those in need (<a href="?bref=Pr.28.27">28:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.29.7">29:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.29.14">14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The benefits of wealth are limited. Occasionally, wealth produces problems rather than solving them (<a href="?bref=Pr.11.4">11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.13.8">13:8</a>). Because wisdom can help where wealth cannot, wisdom is much more important than money (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.16-17">15:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.8">16:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.16.16">16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">All things being equal, the godly will be rewarded with material blessings and the opportunity to be generous. However, all things are not equal. Sometimes wealth does not go to the deserving (see <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.11">Eccl 9:11</a>), nor does it necessarily produce satisfaction (see <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.17-23">Eccl 2:17-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.5.10-17">5:10-17</a>). In fact, money can be detrimental to faith (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.10">1 Tim 6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.1-13">Jas 2:1-13</a>). When a choice must be made between godliness and money, the wise will choose godliness.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Bribes</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Some verses in Scripture condemn bribes as perverting justice (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.27">15:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.17.23">17:23</a>). Yet bribes can be used for good purposes and may even be encouraged (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.8">17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.16">18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.21.14">21:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">As with other topics in Proverbs, the teaching on bribery may seem contradictory, but these proverbs all ring true when applied to the right circumstances, which seem to be connected to the reason for which a bribe or gift is given. If someone gives a bribe so that a judge will condemn an innocent person or set a guilty person free, then it is an evil bribe (see <a href="?bref=Exod.23.8">Exod 23:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.19">Deut 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.25">27:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.15.5">Ps 15:5</a>). However, if a bribe helps an innocent person to find justice or serves some good purpose, then it seems to be allowable. An example of the latter from modern times might be a “gift” to a foreign immigration official that expedites the processing of a visa for a missionary.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Children and Parents</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Wise children bring great joy to their parents, while foolish children cause them much grief (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.1">Prov 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.20">15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.17.21">17:21</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.17.25">25</a>).

<p class="theme-body">When children need discipline, parents should not shirk their responsibility, because the consequences are dangerous to the child (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.15">22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.13-14">23:13-14</a>).

This knowledge will lead children to obedience and blessing. Children, for their part, must show godly parents the respect that is due to them (<a href="?bref=Pr.20.20">Prov 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.11-14">30:11-14</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.30.17">17</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-body-fl">God created Adam and Eve and put them in the Garden to tend it, not just to sit back and enjoy it (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.15">Gen 2:15</a>). Work is not a result of the Fall but rather is a dignified and important part of creation.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Proverbs frequently condemns laziness.

<p class="theme-title">Pride and Humility</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Pride is a natural human response to success and achievement, and the world places great value on recognition and fame (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.16">1 Jn 2:16</a>). Yet, pride is rooted in self-centeredness, and it often exists side by side with the diminishment of others. Scripture frequently cautions against pride and its destructive results, encouraging instead an attitude of humility.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Proverbs links humility with wisdom (see <a href="?bref=Pr.11.2">Prov 11:2</a>), which has its foundation in the fear of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">1:7</a>), a recognition of God’s sovereignty and centrality. A humble person is able to recognize their mistakes and listen to another’s correction (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.17">10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.12.1">12:1</a>). Pride, meanwhile, can block one’s ability to learn from others, leads to conflict (<a href="?bref=Pr.13.10">13:10</a>), and results in disgrace (<a href="?bref=Pr.11.2">11:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the divine economy, pride results in destruction and humiliation while humility leads to honor (<a href="?bref=Pr.11.2">16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.12">18:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.29.23">29:23</a>). When Jesus was asked “Who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” he responded by pointing to the exemplary humility of a little child (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.1-5">Matt 18:1-5</a>). On another occasion, Jesus told a parable that contrasted the prideful prayer of a religious leader and the humble prayer of a tax collector, concluding with the words, “Those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted” (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.9-14">Luke 18:9-14</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.23.8-12">Matt 23:8-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.7-11">Luke 14:7-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus himself provided the ultimate example in humility. Though being God’s son, he “did not think of equality with God as something to cling to,” but rather he “took the humble position of a slave” and “humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on a cross” (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-8">Phil 2:6-8</a>). God calls us to display the same kind of self-sacrificial humility in our own lives (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.3-5">Phil 2:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.16">1 Jn 3:16</a>).</p>

<title>All Is “Vapor”</title>
<refs>Eccl.1.2-9.12</refs>

<p class="theme-title">All Is “Vapor”</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">A key word in Ecclesiastes is the Hebrew term <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> (“vapor,” often translated “meaningless”). This word expresses the core of the Teacher’s judgment concerning life in this world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At its root, <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> means physical “breath” or “vapor.” <span class="hebrew">Hebel</span> is used seventy-eight times in the Old Testament, but in only three instances is the physical meaning clearly intended (<a href="?bref=Ps.62.9">Ps 62:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.21.6">Prov 21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.57.13">Isa 57:13</a>). In the other seventy-five instances, the word is used metaphorically to describe what is incomprehensible, futile, meaningless, false, transitory, or insubstantial. The term is often used to describe the insubstantiality, unreality, and worthlessness of false gods (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.21">Deut 32:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.15">2 Kgs 17:15</a>). In this sense, <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> is the opposite of “glory”—the substantial, weighty, and lasting presence of God. Sometimes the word <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> stands for the way life is fleeting and momentary, like vapor (<a href="?bref=Job.7.16">Job 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.4">Ps 144:4</a>). In other cases, it refers to the meaninglessness and frustration of life (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.33">Pss 78:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.11">94:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.4">Isa 49:4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">There is a long tradition of understanding <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> in Ecclesiastes as meaning “vanity,” not in the sense of thinking too highly of oneself, but in the sense of experiencing life as futile and without purpose or meaning. The ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament used the word <span class="greek">mataiotēs</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “emptiness” or “futility.” The Latin Vulgate then translated <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> with the Latin word <span class="latin">vanitas</span>, which means “purposelessness, pointlessness, hollowness, worthlessness.” From the Vulgate comes the long-standing tradition of translating the word as “vanity” in English. Most translators today understand the word <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> in this sense: Life on earth has no apparent purpose or meaning, and all that we do is futile.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Some translators, however, understand <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> in Ecclesiastes to be referring primarily to the transitory impermanence of life. Vapor has no permanence or weight. This translation leads to a different understanding of Ecclesiastes: Life is not so much meaningless and futile as it is impermanent and fleeting. Many phrases in Ecclesiastes allude to the fleeting nature of human life and its efforts. In the New Testament, a similar thought can be found in <a href="?bref=Jas.4.13-15">James 4:13-15</a>. The understanding of <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> as “impermanence” in Ecclesiastes has merit in explaining the book coherently; it is, however, a minority view among scholars.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The NLT translates <span class="hebrew">hebel</span> in Ecclesiastes as “meaningless.” However, while reading Ecclesiastes, it is helpful to keep in mind the root of the word (“breath” or “vapor”) that stands behind the metaphors.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The brevity, frustration, and apparent meaninglessness of life can be depressing. This discouragement should motivate us toward working more wisely and diligently and enjoying life while we can. We have all observed the apparent absurdity of life’s tragedies, such as the success of a wicked fool or unchecked injustice. But these things come into proportion when we remember God’s sovereignty, because “God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.12.14">Eccl 12:14</a>).</p>

<title>Enjoying God’s Gifts</title>
<refs>Eccl.5.18-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Enjoying God’s Gifts</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The conclusion of many of the Teacher’s reflections in Ecclesiastes is that we are responsible for enjoying life because it is God’s gift (see <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.24-25">2:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.12-13">3:12-13</a>, <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.22">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.5.18">5:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.6.9">6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.8.15">8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.7-9">9:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.11.7-10">11:7-10</a>). Although there are conditions in which it would seemingly be better not to be alive, life is meant to be enjoyed with laughing, dancing, love, and peace. It is especially worth living when old age and death challenge that joy (<a href="?bref=Eccl.9.4">9:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.10">10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.11.7-9">11:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.1">12:1</a>). We are to enjoy our food, drink, health, proper clothes, our loving spouse, children, daily work, and entertainment. It may be surprising to hear such joy in Ecclesiastes, a book that acknowledges such intense tragedy and frustration. But it is exactly this balance of joy and sorrow that characterizes the wise person who reflects on all of life and understands its complexities in a fallen world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It is when we treat the things of life and their enjoyment as ends in themselves that they are deterrents to happiness. The Teacher speaks strongly against the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake as foolish and without profit (<a href="?bref=Eccl.2.1-2">2:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.4">7:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.10.16-19">10:16-19</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Isa.22.13">Isa 22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.56.12">56:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.19-20">Luke 12:19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament encourages us to be joyful in all things, including trials and challenges (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.4">Phil 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.2">Jas 1:2</a>). One tradition in Christianity states that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever” (<span class="ital">Westminster Shorter Catechism,</span> Question 1).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Remember Him</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God rescued the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and made them his own people. Yet God knew that in spite of these striking realities, his people would be prone to forget him (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.16-21">Deut 31:16-21</a>). Moses cautioned the people who were about to enter the Promised Land to never forget what the Lord had done for them (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.1-20">Deut 8:1-20</a>). Sure enough the people of Israel forgot the Lord, which ultimately led to their exile from the land God had given them (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Jer.2.32">Jer 2:32</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Teacher in Ecclesiastes likewise pointed to the importance of remembering the Lord. After reflecting throughout the book on the temporality and futility of numerous aspects of life, the Teacher concludes his observations by admonishing his readers to remember the one who is not fleeting (<a href="?bref=Eccl.12.1-7">Eccl 12:1-7</a>). No one is able to remain young forever; aging and death are a universal part of life. As such, the Teacher encourages people to focus on God while they are young—before it’s too late. God will hold each of us accountable for all that we do (<a href="?bref=Eccl.12.13-14">Eccl 12:13-14</a>); how we live in the present must be informed by the reality of his future judgment.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Beauty in Nature</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">At the end of God’s work of Creation, God declared that everything he had made was “very good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">Gen 1:31</a>). The beauty and wonder of God’s creation is often reflected on in Scripture, particularly in the psalms (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.8.3-4">Ps 8:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.1-35">Ps 104:1-35</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nature—and imagery from nature—also features prominently in the Song of Songs. The man and woman in the Song often express sexual intimacy in the countryside (<a href="?bref=Song.2.8-17">2:8-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.12-5.1">4:12–5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.6.2-3">6:2-3</a>, <a href="?bref=Song.6.11-12">11-12</a>), a place of pleasant fragrances and secluded meeting places. The garden, vineyard, and orchard create intimate and pleasant settings and evoke a romantic mood. The mystique of nature provides them with the environment in which their love is the most rustic, and at the same time the most exotic and exhilarating. Additionally, the couple uses extensive metaphors from nature to describe each other’s physical attributes and their arousing effects. Their portrayal of each other leads them to use illustrations from God’</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nature points people to the Creator, as it contains evidence of his power, goodness, justice, and love (see <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-4">Ps 19:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-20">Rom 1:18-20</a>). God’s penchant for redemption, restoration, and new creation is also evidenced in many ways through the beauty of nature—for instance, in the changing of seasons, the growth of plants, and the birth of children.</p>

<title>Religious Hypocrisy</title>
<refs>Isa.1.11-17</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Religious Hypocrisy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Religious hypocrisy can result from selective obedience, from lip service to God’s law without a change of heart and life to back it up. People who parade their piety for others to see often have little desire to truly obey God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Isaiah preached to what seemed to be a very religious people. They fasted, said prayers, celebrated holy days, and brought their sacrifices to Jerusalem. Yet God rejected these practices. Why? These acts had value—the Lord himself had prescribed them! But the people’s worship was not from the heart, and it was not accompanied by the personal holiness and social justice that God requires (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.19.13-17">Lev 19:13-17</a>). The people of Judah had fallen into the trap of religious hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Many years after Isaiah, Jesus confronted this kind of hypocrisy in the Pharisees. He challenged them to be better doers of God’s <span class="ital">whole</span> revelation rather than just the parts that brought them acclaim (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-36">Matt 23:1-36</a>, especially <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Matt 23:23</a>). The apostles Paul and James also distinguished between mere religiosity and true spirituality (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.1-23">1 Cor 3:1-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.21-2.13">Jas 1:21–2:13</a>). Jesus’ rebuke of the Pharisees also serves as a warning to us: We are not to be like them (see <a href="?bref=Matt.6.1-18">Matt 6:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.1">1 Pet 2:1</a>). Instead, Jesus calls us to be authentic before God and with others, to obey his entire word, and to go beyond mere formalities and appearances in our devotion to God.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Fearing People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God had promised to be with his people in the face of opposition (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.20.1-4">Deut 20:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.1.9">Josh 1:9</a>); as long as they remained committed to him, they had no reason to fear others. Israel’s history demonstrated this reality (see <a href="?bref=Exod.14.10-31">Exod 14:10-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.9-14">Josh 10:9-14</a>). But for those who look elsewhere for peace and security, God can be a stumbling stone rather than a source of safety (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.14">Isa 8:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">During the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, when the king heard that Syria and Israel had allied against him, he trembled in fear (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.2">Isa 7:2</a>). The Lord encouraged him to be a man of faith, because without faith he could not expect the Lord’s protection (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.9">7:9</a>). However, Ahaz refused to trust the Lord. Rather, he turned to the Assyrians for help. As a result, the Lord became a trap for him, as well as for all Israel and Judah (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.11-15">8:11-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">One of the purposes of Isaiah’s message was to highlight the contrast between faith and fear. We see Ahaz as an example of fear. We then see Hezekiah as an imperfect example of faith (see ch <a href="?bref=Isa.37.1-38">37</a>). Isaiah himself provides a better example of faith (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.8.1-22">8</a>). Finally, God’s servant stands as the ideal example of faith (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-7">42:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.4-7">50:4-7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus instructed his followers not to fear those who threaten them—even those who wish to kill them (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.26-31">Matt 10:26-31</a>). The same God who is aware of the happenings of each individual sparrow and who knows the number of hairs on a person’s head will be with those who trust in him. Such trust has been demonstrated by believers throughout history who have rejected the fear of what others can do to them—even to the point of martyrdom (see <a href="?bref=Acts.6.8-7.60">Acts 6:8–7:60</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Those who do not commit themselves wholly to God will live in fear of others. But those who rely on the Lord will be able to overcome such fear, recognizing the temporality of human foes and the enduring sovereignty of God.</p>

<p class="theme-body-fl">The prophet Isaiah saw that mere humans prove untrustworthy (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.22">Isa 2:22</a>). When in distress, the people of Judah often sought help from other nations (e.g., Egypt or Assyria), but Isaiah pointed out that Judah’s success and security was based upon their trust in God (see <a href="?bref=Isa.8.9-17">8:9-17</a>). King Hezekiah was mocked by the Assyrian army for trusting in God, yet it was that very trust that led to a great victory for God’s people (<a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-37.37">36:1–37:37</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Remnant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the face of foreign invasion and the prospect of exile, the notion of the remnant was a source of hope for God’s people (see <a href="?bref=Mic.2.12-13">Mic 2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.6-8">4:6-8</a>). While the Exile would be the outworking of God’s judgment on his people, God indicated that he would not completely destroy them (see <a href="?bref=Hos.11.8-11">Hos 11:8-11</a>). The fact that a remnant was preserved demonstrated God’s mercy and faithfulness.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The theme of the remnant was integral to Isaiah’s message. In fact, one of his sons was named Shear-jashub, which means “a remnant will return” (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Isa 7:3</a>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.10.21">10:21</a>). Isaiah prophesied that when the Lord judged his people with destruction (which occurred at the hands of the Babylonians in 605–586 <span class="era">BC</span>), he would save a small community—the remnant—to be the core of a new beginning. Because the population of Judah would be decimated (as the northern kingdom of Israel had been already), this remnant would be a very small beginning. It is depicted as a “branch” (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.2">4:2</a>), a “stump” (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.13">6:13</a>), a community of the “poor” and “needy” (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.4">25:4</a>), and “handpicked grain” (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.12-13">27:12-13</a>). This remnant was to put their trust in the Lord while waiting for him to establish his rule and come to reward them (see <a href="?bref=Isa.3.10">3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.10">40:10</a>). The Lord promised that this small community would swell into a huge multitude that would come out of both Israel and the Gentile nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.6">27:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.3">60:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In fulfillment of prophecy, a remnant of God’s people were allowed to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple during the reign of King Cyrus of Persia (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezra 1:2-4</a>). Ezra the priest recognized this preservation of a remnant as purely an act of God’s grace, an act that could be jeopardized if the people followed their ancestors in disobedience (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.5-15">Ezra 9:5-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The notion of the remnant serves as an encouragement to remain faithful to God in the midst of the unfaithfulness of others. In the case of the people of Israel and Judah, such faithfulness would lead to the restoration of their land and to the blessings God had promised his people.</p>

<title>The Day of the Lord</title>
<refs>Isa.13.4-22</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Day of the Lord</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The expression <span class="ital">day of the</span> <span class="divine-name-ital">Lord</span> refers to a time of retribution when God judges his enemies in wrath and fury. The ungodly receive the punishment they deserve, while the righteous enter into their full salvation (see <a href="?bref=Isa.3.9-11">Isa 3:16–4:6</a>). On the day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, God manifests his awe-inspiring lordship over creation. When God comes in glory, humans experience terror (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.10">2:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.2.19">19</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.2.21">21</a>) because all human support structures (religious, economic, military, social) come under his scrutiny.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This expression first appeared in the prophecy of Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.18">Amos 5:18</a>), but evidently it did not originate with him. Amos was correcting a popular misunderstanding that the Israelites already held. They believed that the day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> would be a joyous day of salvation when God would intervene in the world to judge Israel’s enemies and reestablish Israelite rule over all of greater Canaan. But Amos warned the Israelites that the day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> would not be light for them, but darkness, for they were in rebellion against him (see <a href="?bref=Amos.5.10-12">Amos 5:10-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Amos.5.21-27">21-27</a>). Self-confident Israelites assumed that God was always on their side, but their sins had, in fact, made them God’s enemies, and they deserved his full punishment.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The expression became part of the standard vocabulary of the prophets, often being referred to simply as “that day” (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.2.11">Isa 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.1">27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.8">Zeph 1:8</a>). In light of God’s warnings and the people’s sinfulness, the prophets envisioned that day as imminent (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Joel.1.15">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.1">2:1</a>). As such, they hoped that their warnings would spur repentance among God’s people (see <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.1-3">Zeph 2:1-3</a>). Unfortunately, their warnings largely fell on deaf ears. The day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came for the northern kingdom when Assyria destroyed Samaria; it came for the southern kingdom when Babylon invaded in 605–586 <span class="era">BC</span> and destroyed Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="theme-body">While the day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is catastrophic for the ungodly—Joel compares its devastation to that of a locust plague (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.1-2.11">Joel 1:1–2:11</a>)—it provides assurance to God’s people that God is sovereign and just, and it serves as a day of salvation for those who have listened to the prophets and turned to the Lord (see <a href="?bref=Joel.2.31-32">Joel 2:31-32</a>). The same God who would bring devastation upon his enemies would be a refuge and a fortress for his people (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.1">Joel 3:11</a>). And the nations that were used by God to bring his judgment upon Israel and Judah would later face their own day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.13.4-22">Isa 13:4-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.1-5">Ezek 30:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.15-16">Obad 1:15-16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">While the judgment referred to by the Old Testament prophets was largely realized in the Exile, New Testament writers picked up the expression <span class="ital">day of the</span> <span class="divine-name-ital">Lord</span> to speak of the return of Christ as judge of all the earth. That day will come “as unexpectedly as a thief” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10">2 Pet 3:10</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.2-4">1 Thes 5:2-4</a>), so God’s people must be prepared—or else face a similar fate to those who failed to heed the warnings of the prophets.</p>

<refs>Isa.29.17-24</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Holy One of Israel</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The phrase <span class="ital">The Holy One of Israel</span> is particularly prominent in the book of Isaiah, occurring around two dozen times. The Holy One is the King (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.5">6:5</a>), the righteous and just one (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.7">26:7</a>), the incomparable God (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.25">40:25</a>), and the Redeemer of his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.14">41:14</a>). Anyone coming to the Holy One must worship him in reverence and awe. The Holy One identifies himself with Mount Zion, called holy because it is his symbolic dwelling place (see <a href="?bref=Isa.18.7">18:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.23">24:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.13">27:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.56.7">56:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.1-22">60:1-22</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Holy One stands apart from all his creation because he is morally perfect. Sinful people cannot dwell with him (see <a href="?bref=Isa.1.4">1:4</a>). God’s holiness requires ritual purity and moral perfection. God is a consuming fire who purges away anything that does not conform to his holy will (see <a href="?bref=Isa.33.14">33:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Yet the Holy One sets aside a remnant for himself (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.2-3">4:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.13">6:13</a>). He washes away their filth and commits to be present with them (<a href="?bref=Isa.12.6">12:6</a>), his own redeemed people (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.8-9">35:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.62.12">62:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Isa.49.7">49:7</a>). He demonstrates his holy power as he comes to the aid of sinful and weak humans, rescues them from the exile that their sin creates, and opens up the new creation for them.</p>

<title>God’s Justice</title>
<refs>Isa.32.16-17</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Justice</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God is just (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.7-8">Ps 9:7-8</a>); he detests sin and rewards people and nations justly in accordance with what they do (<a href="?bref=Ps.67.4">Ps 67:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.27">Isa 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.28">Jer 46:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.1-8">Joel 3:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">Acts 17:31</a>). God is in sovereign control of the natural world (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.4-6">Nah 1:4-6</a>, <a href="?bref=Nah.1.8">8</a>) and of all nations (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.3">1:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Nah.1.6-10">6-10</a>, <a href="?bref=Nah.1.15">15</a>), and the world and its inhabitants stand helpless when opposing him (<a href="?bref=Job.41.10-11">Job 41:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.22-24">Isa 40:22-24</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord’s justice (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">mishpat</span>) is part of his divine order. A world without justice is a place where people set aside the order planned by the Creator. Since the Creator himself is just (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.4">Deut 32:4</a>), it follows that his rule will be just and righteous. His Messiah will usher in a just world (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">Isa 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.2-5">11:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.5">16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.1-2">32:1-2</a>), and his Spirit will transform the world into a place of justice, righteousness, and peace (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.15-17">32:15-17</a>). This is good news for the oppressed, whose rights have been denied by the powerful of society (see <a href="?bref=Isa.25.4-5">25:4-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s justice may sometimes seem slow in coming (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.3">Nah 1:3</a>). This seemingly delayed judgment is the result of his patience and mercy toward people (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.1-4.11">Jon 3–4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.9-15">2 Pet 3:9-15</a>). God does not execute justice with rigid disinterest; he gives justice with love and seeks to bring those who deserve judgment into a relationship with him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The theme of God’s justice is notably prominent throughout the prophets, and particularly in the book of Isaiah. God expects his people to act justly toward others (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">Mic 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.9">Zech 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.17">Isa 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.7">5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.6-7">58:6-7</a>), and he repeately censures the people of Israel for their injustice, particularly toward the poor and needy (e.g., <a href="?bref=Amos.5.11-12">Amos 5:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">Mal 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.12-15">Isa 3:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.7-8">5:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.1-4">10:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.29.21">29:21</a>). Many of Israel’s prophets proclaim God’s judgment on his people in relation to their injustice. They also relay a number of prophecies against other oppressive, proud, unjust nations. God’s retribution for such behavior is just (see <a href="?bref=Isa.3.9-11">Isa 3:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.13.11">13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.18">59:18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Nahum is specifically filled with the expression of God’s justice toward Nineveh (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.14">1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.2.13">2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.3.4">3:4</a>). Nahum’s “good news” (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.15">Nah 1:15</a>) is that all who trust in God will one day enjoy the peace and well-being that come with the final defeat of evil (see also <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-9">Isa 11:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.13">Zeph 3:13</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this promise was inaugurated in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.34-43">Acts 10:34-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.9-15">Rom 10:9-15</a>). Those who believe in the Lord Jesus experience a measure of the blessings of salvation in the present as they await God’s final judgment of evil and the coming of his Kingdom in its fullness (see <a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-22.5">Rev 20:7–22:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In reality, all humanity stands condemned before the just and holy God. Yet God also provides undeserved grace. In Jesus Christ, God poured out his just judgment on a willing substitute, whose death calls people to turn away from their sin and live by God’s righteousness (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.22-23">Rom 6:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">1 Pet 3:18</a>). And when God’s kingdom is fully established through Christ, the world, too, will be just and righteous (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.26">Isa 1:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.6">28:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pet 3:13</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Servant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">Isaiah 40–66</a> the figure of God’s servant features prominently. The servant proclaims a new order of justice and righteousness to the world (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.3-4">42:3-4</a>) and serves as God’s instrument to prepare the world for God’s coming (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.7">52:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Who is the Lord’s servant? Isaiah identifies the servant with Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.8">41:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.1-2">44:1-2</a>), who serves as God’s witness (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.10">43:10</a>) and as a light to the Gentiles. Yet Israel could not fully complete this mission: Israel was deaf, blind, and in need of God’s forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.19">42:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.21-22">44:21-22</a>). Israel failed again and again. By contrast, God’s servant is faithful and waits for the coming redemption (see <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-3">61:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.62.1-5">62:1-5</a>). The servant thus represents the godly in Israel. The servant is God’s faithful witness to humanity, and he stands in opposition to the idolatrous practices of paganism.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Isaiah portrays the servant as an obedient individual who suffers. The notion of the “suffering servant” found fulfillment in one particular Israelite who was perfectly faithful and suffered on behalf of others: Jesus Christ. By his suffering, God’s blessings came to many, including other nations (see <a href="?bref=Acts.26.22-23">Acts 26:22-23</a>). In union and fellowship with Christ, the apostles ministered as his servants to both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.47">Acts 13:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.14-18">26:14-18</a>). All those who have faith in Christ share in the mission of the servant and fulfill the role of God’s servants in the world (e.g., <a href="?bref=Col.1.7">Col 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.12">4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.6">1 Tim 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.24">2 Tim 2:24</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Promise of a Second Exodus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Like the exodus from Egypt, Israel’s return from exile would restore God’s people to the land. Just as they had left Egypt many years before, the people of Israel would leave Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.20-21">Isa 48:20-21</a>). This time they would have to be cleansed (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.11">52:11</a>) and would not rush their departure (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.12">52:12</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Both the experience in exile and the journey are likened to a desert (see <a href="?bref=Isa.35.1">35:1</a>) from which the Lord would bring rescue. He prepares a road through the desert (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.19">43:19</a>), transforms the desert into a watering hole with vegetation and animals (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.19-20">43:19-20</a>), removes obstacles along the way (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.16">42:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.11">49:11</a>), guides his people through the desert (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.16">42:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.11">58:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.13">63:13</a>), feeds them (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.10">49:10</a>), protects them from the desert heat (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.10">49:10</a>), and strengthens them (<a href="?bref=Isa.58.11">58:11</a>). He changes the experience of the exiles from sorrow to great joy (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.3">51:3</a>) and pours out his Spirit on them (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.3-4">44:3-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">An exodus of sorts also occurs for all those who believe in Christ—an exodus from sin and death through Christ’s death and the power of his resurrection. The Holy Spirit enables believers to live in newness of life and to serve God with joy as they await the coming of his kingdom in all its fullness.</p>

<title>Salvation in Isaiah</title>
<refs>Isa.59.15-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Salvation in Isaiah</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Isaiah’s name means <span class="ital">Yahweh is salvation</span>. He calls on people to turn away from their many false saviors to the only true Savior and protector. Salvation involves all aspects of existence (physical, spiritual, etc.). For example, the word <span class="ital">salvation</span> sometimes occurs in the book of Isaiah together with <span class="ital">righteousness</span> to signify a harmonious order where injustice, disgrace, and mourning are absent (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.8">45:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.8">51:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Isaiah repeatedly relays the good news that the Lord is coming to restore his people (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.4.2-6">4:2-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.24-34">10:24-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.9-11">40:9-11</a>). Even though punishment and exile were coming because of the people’s wickedness, the Lord would not abandon his people. Rather, he would deliver them: Babylon would fall, and the anguish and humiliation of the Exile would end. Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.1.1-39.8">1–39</a> anticipate this message, while chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a> describe it clearly.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Isaiah also points to the salvation that God would bring through Jesus Christ. He prophesies about a “Branch” that would come from the line of David who would have the Spirit and would bring justice and righteousness (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">11:1-5</a>). He also speaks of God’s servant, who would suffer for the sins of the people (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>). Jesus fulfilled these prophecies of Isaiah and brought deliverance from sin and death.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The New Order</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Isaiah differentiates the <span class="ital">old order,</span> the present world of human powers and pressures, from the <span class="ital">new order,</span> a new creation where justice and harmony triumph.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The old order evokes memories of weeping (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.19">65:19</a>), death (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.20">65:20</a>), oppression and violence (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.21-22">65:21-22</a>), and the absence of God (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.24">65:24</a>). It is characterized by human power and pride.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Isaiah’s vision of the new order centers on the Lord as the Great King in his holiness and glory (see <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-5">6:1-5</a>). God’s people experience aspects of the new order in this life, such as God’s comfort (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.1">40:1</a>), salvation (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.22">45:22</a>), joy (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.14-15">24:14-15</a>), righteousness (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.16">24:16</a>), peace (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.3">26:3</a>), divine blessing, and protection. Other dimensions lie beyond our experience: the end of death (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.7-8">25:7-8</a>); the resurrection (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.19">26:19</a>); the cessation of enmity, corruption, and evil (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.18">60:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.65.25">65:25</a>); the full enjoyment of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.19">60:19</a>); and God’s uncontested rule in his eternal kingdom (see <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">Rev 21–22</a>).

<title>The Broken Covenant</title>
<refs>Jer.2.1-3.10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Broken Covenant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">A central issue in the Lord’s relationship with Israel was whether the covenant made at Sinai (see <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-24.18">Exod 20–24</a>), which the people had broken, was still valid. In the politics of the ancient Near East, covenantal agreements were common. When one of the partners in a covenant broke the terms of the agreement, the result was usually war. The Sinai covenant was unique because the Lord was one of the covenant partners. The covenant was patterned after secular covenants—it required the Lord and Israel to seal the agreement with solemn oaths of faithfulness (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-11">Exod 24:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.29.1-30.20">Deut 29–30</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-35">Josh 8:30-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.1-28">24:1-28</a>). The Lord always remained faithful to his covenant commitment, but the Israelite people repeatedly broke the covenant as Canaanite polytheism lured them away from the Lord. They broke the laws banning the worship of idols, engaged in immoral sexual rituals, mistreated the poor and needy, and ignored God’s requirements for righteousness.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For centuries, the Israelites swung back and forth between worship of the Lord God and worship of Canaanite deities. Whenever they repented and returned to the Lord, he mercifully took them back into the covenant relationship. However, by the mid-700s <span class="era">BC</span>, the Israelites of the northern kingdom of Israel had become stubbornly resolute in their idol worship. So the Lord let the Assyrians destroy the kingdom and take many people into captivity.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At the time of Jeremiah’s ministry, over one hundred years later, Judah was headed down the same road. Jeremiah likened this tragedy to the breakup of a marriage relationship, much as Hosea had pictured it earlier for Israel (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.1-3.25">Jer 2–3</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Hos.1.1-2.23">Hos 1–2</a>). Israel’s bond with the Lord is portrayed as a marriage in which the bride forsook her husband and took up with other lovers. The Lord charged his people with violating the marriage bond and acting like a prostitute (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.1">Jer 3:1</a>), and he warned them to return to him or face destruction. God could no longer say of the Israelites, “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (see <a href="?bref=Jer.31.33">Jer 31:33</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Exod.6.7">Exod 6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.1.9">Hos 1:9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Just as breaking the covenant had cost the northern kingdom its existence, so it later destroyed the kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem was torn apart, and the Temple was destroyed. This punishment cut deeply and painfully into God’s heart. The ever-merciful Lord promised a new covenant to replace the broken Sinai covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>).</p>

<title>Basic Laws</title>
<refs>Jer.5.1-6</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Basic Laws</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout Scripture, the one true God is the highest authority; his laws are set out both as positive commands and as negative prohibitions. The positive side can be summed up in two basic laws: “You must love the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength” (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Deut 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Matt 22:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.30">Mark 12:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.27">Luke 10:27</a>), and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lev 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.19">Matt 19:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.31">Mark 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.27">Luke 10:27</a>). These two basic laws are reflected in the positive laws in the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-17">Exod 20:2-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.6-21">Deut 5:6-21</a>): “Observe the Sabbath day. . . . Honor your father and mother.” These commands open the door to the expression of “faith, hope, and love” (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.13">1 Cor 13:13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The negative prohibitions set up a boundary between good and evil. Primary among these laws are the first two of the Ten Commandments: “You must not have any other god but me” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.3">Exod 20:3</a>), and “You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image . . . You must not bow down to them or worship them” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4-5">Exod 20:4-5</a>). These prohibited behaviors violate the fundamental command to love the Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the books of the prophets, these laws lie behind God’s evaluation of the Israelites’ conduct—as well as the conduct of any ruler, group of people, or individual in any time or place. Those who violate these core laws reject the one true God, resulting in decrees of divine judgment and disastrous consequences.</p>

<refs>Jer.6.22-26</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Invasion</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the ancient world, invasions by foreign powers were relatively common. When they occurred, they brought great hardship; and if the invaders succeeded, what followed was staggering: destruction and suffering as the victorious invaders killed the adult men, raped the women, enslaved the children, plundered all that was valuable, and destroyed everything else. The threat of invasion brought terror.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the last decades of the monarchy, the people of Judah and Jerusalem were living in the shadow of Babylon and under constant threat of hostile conquest. Over a century earlier, the Assyrians had destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel, had flooded into Judah, and had besieged Jerusalem. These events were still fresh in the memories of the people of Judah. The prophet Jeremiah warned of another impending invasion and the desolation it would bring.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In times when invasion threatened, it was tempting to look for anything that could prevent the suffering that was coming. Prophets like Jeremiah encouraged God’s people to turn away from false gods and back to the Lord, to stop looking to powerful allies to rescue them and instead look to the Lord for protection. The prophets sometimes also painted a vivid picture of exactly what would happen when invasion came. Their purpose was not to cause terror or to dishearten God’s people, but to turn them back to the Lord so that they would trust in him to save them and experience his rescue. This is precisely how Hezekiah had responded to the Assyrian invasion a century earlier—he turned to the Lord, and the Lord had indeed rescued him and his people.</p>

<refs>Jer.10.1-16</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Uniqueness</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As Creator, God stands wholly apart from the things he has created. God is not part of nature; he created and rules nature. He has always existed as the living God, the intelligent Designer who decreed that the universe should function according to his laws. He gave life to all living beings. As God, he is present everywhere and knows all things. He is the living God of love, holiness, justice, and power.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The nations around Israel worshiped numerous gods, who were often identified with elements of the natural world. These nature deities and their images were false, lifeless, and immobile (see <a href="?bref=Jer.10.1-5">Jer 10:1-5</a>). They could not communicate with people or relate to individuals. They could not even move about by their own power, because they had no power. Unfortunately, God’s people often followed the idolatrous practices of their neighbors, leading the prophets to remind the people of God’s uniqueness.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In contrast to lifeless idols, the one, true, living God relates to his specially made humans on a personal basis, despite his otherness. He reaches into the lives of individuals and reveals his will so that each person can understand his desires and respond to him.

<title>God Protects His Servant</title>
<refs>Jer.11.18-23</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God Protects His Servant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When God called Jeremiah as his messenger, he promised to protect him. One aspect of this protection was spiritual, as the Lord gave Jeremiah the inner strength of a fortified city (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.18">Jer 1:18</a>). God’s protection was also physical: “They will fight you, but they will fail” (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.19">1:19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">During Josiah’s reign (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>), Jeremiah did not encounter much personal danger, but the situation changed dramatically when Jehoiakim came to power (609–598 <span class="era">BC</span>). Hostility from the king and his officials surfaced quickly, and Jeremiah suddenly found his life in danger. But the Lord reassured him of divine protection (see <a href="?bref=Jer.11.18-23">11:18-23</a>). That promise seemed to be contradicted when Pashhur arrested Jeremiah, had him whipped, and placed him in stocks (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.1-2">20:1-2</a>). Jeremiah rebuked the Lord for seemingly misleading him, but he soon regained his trust in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.7-13">20:7-13</a>). On another occasion early in Jehoiakim’s reign, Jeremiah was arrested and placed on trial (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.26.1-24">26</a>). The Lord fulfilled his promise to strengthen Jeremiah inwardly, which allowed the prophet to remain calm. Physical protection came from some elders in the community who had served under King Josiah. They reminded the group of Hezekiah’s response to danger a century before, and Ahikam saved Jeremiah’s life (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.24">26:24</a>). Jeremiah then went into hiding when Jehoiakim’s officers sought to kill him, and the Lord allowed Jeremiah to remain hidden until after Jehoiakim’s death (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.19-20">36:19-20</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.36.26">26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The new king, Zedekiah, was kinder to Jeremiah; nonetheless, Jeremiah’s life was in danger several times during the siege of Jerusalem. At one point, the king’s officials cast him into a muddy cistern. God protected Jeremiah by prompting a foreigner, Ebed-melech, to rescue the prophet. Zedekiah then placed Jeremiah in protective custody (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.38.1-28">38</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jeremiah survived the fall of Jerusalem, though he was almost taken captive to Babylon. God prompted the Babylonian general to release Jeremiah from bondage and to give him a choice between going to Babylon as a free man and staying with Gedaliah, the newly appointed governor of Judah (<a href="?bref=Jer.39.11-14">39:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.40.1-6">40:1-6</a>). God also protected Jeremiah from Johanan and his companions, who took Jeremiah and Baruch to Egypt against their will (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.1-7">43:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God faithfully kept his promises to Jeremiah, as he still faithfully keeps his promises to all his people. He does not always promise to physically protect those who serve him (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.4-5">2 Cor 6:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10-13">2 Tim 2:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.11-13">3:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21-23">1 Pet 2:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.14-17">3:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.12">Rev 14:12</a>), but he does promise eternal salvation to those who trust in him (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">Jas 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6-9">1 Pet 1:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">4:12-19</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Lord of Nations</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Both the Old Testament and the New Testament affirm that the Lord is the one true God and that God is supreme over all nations and all peoples in all ages, even when rulers in those nations do not believe in or acknowledge him. Kings and emperors might believe that they control all events in their realms, but they are wrong. The Lord God is ultimately in control.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Old Testament prophets declared that the Lord God of Israel decided who would become king or emperor of each nation. Rulers were held accountable before God concerning the morality of their policies and how they were carried out. This claim is apparent in <a href="?bref=Jer.18.1-23">Jeremiah 18</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.25.1-38">25</a>, and <a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-51.64">46–51</a>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nations that failed to recognize the reality of the one true God would suffer severe judgment. For selected nations, God softened the judgment by promising that a remnant would remain (see <a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-51.64">Jer 46–51</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord desires every nation on earth to be converted to sincere devotion and commitment to him. He has always wanted all people to live righteous lives and to experience the joy of truly worshiping him. The book of Revelation envisions the future worship of God by people “from every nation and tribe and people and language” (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.9-10">Rev 7:9-10</a>).</p>

<title>The Choice of Life or Death</title>
<refs>Jer.18.7-10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Choice of Life or Death</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In Moses’ instructions to the Israelites when they were on the cusp of entering the Promised Land, the people were presented with a choice: Obey the covenant—life as God designed it—and live, or refuse to obey the Creator’s design and die (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.19">Deut 30:19</a>). This choice—and its ramifications—resounded throughout God’s covenant dealings with his people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The specific terminology of Deuteronomy 30 resurfaces in Jeremiah, in the context of the Babylonian invasion: “Take your choice of life or death” (<a href="?bref=Jer.21.8">Jer 21:8</a>). The prophet warned King Zedekiah and his people to submit to the Lord’s instruction. If they did, they would live; if not, they would die. Earlier in Jeremiah’s ministry, the Lord confronted the people of Judah with an opportunity to change and come home to him (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.12-4.4">3:12–4:4</a>). If they rejected idol worship, admitted their guilt, and confessed that they were rebels, God would cleanse their minds and hearts, and they could live peacefully in the land. However, the people scornfully rejected this offer again and again (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.5-7">7:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.8-11">18:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.22">23:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.26.13">26:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.12-13">27:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.32">29:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.35.15">35:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.36.3-7">36:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.5">44:5</a>). So the Lord repeatedly warned them that if they rejected the path of life, they would experience judgment.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Jeremiah’s day, only a few chose life; the majority rebelled and experienced death. In the end, the people led by Zedekiah ignored the Lord, defied the Babylonian army, and indeed suffered judgment. They intentionally rejected the gift of life.</p>

<title>The Collapse of Culture</title>
<refs>Jer.24.1-10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Collapse of Culture</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Impressive cultures full of creative and skilled people sometimes fall apart suddenly and completely. While digging, archaeologists often find a layer of ash between strata of remarkable artifacts; the ash indicates the destruction of the culture. This is one of the most disturbing aspects of human history.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Israel’s history is replete with cycles of courage and success followed by disaster. People of God led Israel into new periods of power (Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon), but the nation repeatedly fell into worshiping deities other than the one true God. Repeatedly, God’s people fell under judgment as their culture disintegrated and their political independence was replaced with servitude and oppression. The northern kingdom of Israel was especially captivated by the idol-worship of Baal and Asherah. As a result, the Lord turned the northern kingdom over to the Assyrians, who demolished it in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Jeremiah’s time, the collapse of spiritual and political culture was occurring in the southern kingdom of Judah. Some of the nation’s kings, including Josiah, faithfully followed the covenant ban on idol worship and led the people of Judah back to the Lord. However, many other rulers, including Josiah’s sons, did not carry on such reforms. For example, Jehoiakim had no interest in continuing his father’s revival of devotion to the Lord, seeing it as an impediment to his own political power. He was so hardened toward the Lord that he tried to kill Jeremiah, the Lord’s messenger. Zedekiah was more fearful than hardened, but he also refused to return to the Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord’s messages through Jeremiah contain strong indictments of Judah’s devotion to Baal (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.8">2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.13">11:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.11.17">17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.16">12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.19.5">19:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.13">23:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.23.27">27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.29">32:29</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.32.35">35</a>) and condemn the immorality that accompanied this idolatry. Judah’s moral depravity and spiritual rottenness—exemplified by its greed, hate, and violence—were exposed for all to see. Despite their stubborn refusal to turn away from idol worship and back to worship of the one true God, the people of Judah hoped that the Lord would work a miracle by defeating the Babylonian army and sending it back home. They thought that the Temple would magically protect them, not understanding that God was disgusted over what they were doing there, which was speeding their destruction rather than protecting them (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.4-15">7:4-15</a>). They were totally unprepared to face the horror of defeat in war and the destruction of their nation, their capital, and their Temple. They were unaware that their spiritual and moral collapse had already made their doom certain.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Hope Beyond Judgment</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The prophets contain many messages of judgment and doom, but rays of hope occasionally shine through.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Jeremiah, the first ray of hope is found in the Lord’s appeal to Israel to turn from idolatry back to the Lord God and the Sinai covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.11-4.2">Jer 3:11–4:2</a>). A positive response would open a bright future for the people. They could know the salvation that heals hearts (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.22-23">3:22-23</a>), and Israel would become a blessing to all nations (<a href="?bref=Jer.4.1-2">4:1-2</a>). The people’s repentance would bring God’s anger to an end, and the nation would not be destroyed. Even in times of crisis before the fall of Jerusalem, promises of a wonderful future offered hope for the nation (see <a href="?bref=Jer.16.15">16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.3-8">23:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.10-14">29:10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.30.1-33.26">30:1–33:26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Even after the fall of Jerusalem, the Lord again offered hope to the exiles in Babylon. After seventy years, the exiles who turned to the Lord would return to the Promised Land to rebuild the Temple and the city of Jerusalem. A functioning community would know peace and prosperity (see <a href="?bref=Jer.46.27-28">46:27-28</a>; chs <a href="?bref=Jer.50.1-51.64">50–51</a>). Babylon would be conquered, and the exiles would return to Judah. These events occurred in 539–538 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Hope for the people of God extended well into the future, as God promised a righteous descendant of King David who would rule over his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">Isa 11:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.15-17">33:15-17</a>). Jesus Christ is that righteous descendant; through his death on the cross, he became the mediator of a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.13-15">Heb 9:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.22-24">12:22-24</a>).

<title>The New Covenant</title>
<refs>Jer.31.31-34</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The New Covenant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The key affirmation of the Sinai covenant was, “I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God” (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.7">Exod 6:7</a>; see <a href="?bref=Jer.31.33">Jer 31:33</a>). The relationship between God and his people envisioned in the Sinai covenant was surrounded by laws chiseled in stone and a priestly class in charge of all religious institutions and activities.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The new covenant would differ from the old in one primary way: It would no longer be external to the worshipers, but would now be written on their hearts (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.33">Jer 31:33</a>). The great liability of the old covenant was that it lacked the power to enable people to do what it commanded (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.3">Rom 8:3</a>). The new covenant would be internalized through the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.24-27">Ezek 36:24-27</a>). Thus, it would become possible for people everywhere (not just a select few) to fulfill God’s covenant plan for life as summed up in the two “Great Commandments” (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.35-40">Matt 22:35-40</a>): “You must love the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God” (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Deut 6:5</a>) and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lev 19:18</a>). The new covenant would achieve the goal that the old one pointed to but could not reach: creating new persons and a new community. The goal is a deep transformation of sinners, beginning with forgiveness of sins and culminating in a holiness exemplified by good works (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.4">Eph 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.8-10">2:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=Jer.30.1-33.26">Jeremiah 30–33</a> stands out in its optimistic view of Israel’s future. The high point of this section (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">31:31-34</a>) is the announcement that the Lord God will form a new covenant with his people. This passage in Jeremiah points toward Jesus of Nazareth, whose death would seal this new covenant. Jesus applied the new covenant to himself when he instituted the communion ritual (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Matt 26:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mark 14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Luke 22:20</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">2 Cor 3:6</a>). Jesus’ death made him the mediator of the covenant for whoever believes in him (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.8-12">Heb 8:8-12</a>; ch <a href="?bref=Jer.9.1-26">9</a>). Christians commemorate that reality each time they participate in Communion. According to the New Testament, all believers in Jesus Christ will know him directly by the activity of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling has been made possible through the sacrifice of Christ. They will know him personally and experience him powerfully, as only a few did in Old Testament times.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Written Word</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When Jeremiah’s ministry was in crisis during his public trial on the Temple grounds (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.1-24">Jer 26</a>), some friends saved his life, but King Jehoiakim had the prophet Uriah killed and tried to arrest Jeremiah. Would this signal the end of Jeremiah’s public ministry? Was public speaking the only way to get the Lord’s messages to the leaders and people of Judah?</p>
<p class="theme-body">As it turns out, killing and silencing the messengers did not stop the Lord’s messages—the Lord’s word could be broadcast effectively in writing. The Lord told Jeremiah to write down all the messages he had ever delivered (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-32">Jer 36</a>). Jeremiah had a helper, Baruch, who was skilled in writing and making as many copies as were needed. While Jeremiah and Baruch were in hiding, they purchased a scroll (a roll of papyrus) and prepared it so as to record the written messages. When the writing was finished, the scroll was read in the Temple courtyard and in the presence of King Jehoiakim. The king cut up the scroll and burned it, but Jeremiah had the messages rewritten on a new scroll, adding new material. Throughout the remainder of Jeremiah’s ministry, he had his messages written on papyrus and sent to the leaders of various countries, as well as to the exiles in Babylon (see <a href="?bref=Jer.29.1-32">Jer 29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The earliest example of writing the word of God appears in Exodus, where Moses was commanded to write down the words of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">Exod 24:4</a>, but see also <a href="?bref=Exod.17.14">Exod 17:14</a>). It is specifically stated that Moses wrote the book of Deuteronomy (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.9">Deut 31:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.31.24">24</a>). The existence of the written book of the Law probably stimulated a tradition of writing down certain elements of what God was revealing (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.26">Josh 24:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.25">1 Sam 10:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.29">2 Chr 9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.16-17">Isa 8:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.8">30:8</a>). Many of Israel’s historical writings are said to have been kept by prophets (see <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.15">2 Chr 12:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.22">13:22</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">These written documents, especially those written on leather scrolls, were kept in communities for a long time, and many copies were made from one document. These copies were so valuable that they were carefully preserved for centuries. The copies were also translated into any number of languages. The book of Jeremiah and the writings of other prophets, wise men, and teachers have been preserved, collected, and handed down to us as the Old and New Testaments, giving us a written record of God’s messages to his people (see <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.16-17">2 Tim 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.20-21">2 Pet 1:20-21</a>).</p>

<title>God’s Glory with His People</title>
<refs>Ezek.1.1-28</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Glory with His People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In ancient Israel, God’s glory was particularly manifest at the central sanctuaries that had been built for him. When the Israelites completed construction of the Tabernacle, that sacred space became filled with the glory of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-35">Exod 40:34-35</a>). Likewise, after the Temple was completed and the Ark of the Covenant was brought in, God’s glorious presence filled the Temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The presence and absence of God’s glory is a central theme in the book of Ezekiel. God’s glory appears to the prophet Ezekiel while he is exiled in Babylon, meaning that his glory was no longer present at the Temple in Jerusalem. The reason God’s glory had departed from the Temple at that time becomes clear in Ezekiel’s vision in <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1-11.25">Ezekiel 8–11</a>, in which the prophet sees the abominations that had polluted the Temple in Jerusalem. Without God’s presence, the Temple had become an empty shell awaiting destruction. God was not forcibly evicted by the superior might of the Babylonian army; he voluntarily departed because his people were defiled. Their sin drove him away from the land he had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For a time, the Lord went from Jerusalem to Babylon to become a sanctuary for the exiles there (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.16">11:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God would not abandon his Temple forever. After pouring out his wrath in full measure, he would restore a remnant to their land and sanctify them by his Spirit so that he could once again dwell in their midst in a new sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.26">37:26</a>). God’s glory, dwelling among his people forever (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-5">43:1-5</a>), is at the heart of Ezekiel’s vision of their restoration.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The glory of God has come to live among us fully in the person of Jesus Christ. As John testifies, “We have seen his glory, the glory of the Father’s one and only Son” (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>). The aged Simeon saw the baby Jesus brought to the Temple and described him as “a light to reveal God to the nations, and . . . the glory of your people Israel” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.32">Luke 2:32</a>). Jesus’ glory was veiled while he was on earth, though for a moment on the Mount of Transfiguration his radiance was revealed to his closest disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.2">Matt 17:2</a>). He experienced his own abandonment by God as he hung on the cross, bearing the curse for our sin (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Matt 27:46</a>). Now, as the exalted and glorified Lord, he sits at God’s right hand (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.19-20">Eph 1:19-20</a>). By his Spirit, he has promised never to abandon us, but to be with us to the end of time (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.20">Matt 28:20</a>).</p>

<title>Prophetic Sign Acts</title>
<refs>Ezek.2.8-3.11</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Prophetic Sign Acts</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The prophets of Israel occasionally communicated through sign acts, which were dramatic visual aids performed in public to increase the impact of the message and help people <span class="ital">feel</span> the truth as much as <span class="ital">hear</span> it. Their purpose was to present an unforgettable message. These acts were unusual, even outlandish—and not just from a modern perspective. Unlike modern readers, however (who might think that the prophet was psychologically disturbed), ancient observers understood these sign acts as a regular part of a prophet’s communication style.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Ezekiel was required to act out his message more frequently than any other prophet, perhaps because he was communicating to a particularly hardened audience (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.6-7">Ezek 2:6-7</a>). The sign acts reinforced the content of his message and underlined the depth of his personal commitment to it. For example, after he swallowed the word of God (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.8-3.3">2:8–3:3</a>), Ezekiel embodied it for the exiles (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.4-9">3:4-9</a>) in a series of judgment scenes (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-6.14">4–6</a>). This dramatic form of communication is difficult for even a hostile audience to ignore or forget.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The ultimate sign act was performed by Jesus Christ on the cross (see <a href="?bref=Matt.27.32-54">Matt 27:32-54</a>). There God visibly depicted his wrath against sin in the darkness, the earthquake, and the agony of the sinless one who was apparently abandoned by his Father. God also depicted his profound love for the world in that he would rather die than let his people go. The cross is a confrontational message of God’s love and wrath that is hard to ignore or forget.</p>

<title>False Prophets</title>
<refs>Ezek.13.1-23</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">False Prophets</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Bible tells of many individuals who set themselves up as prophets on their own authority. They had no true calling from God but nonetheless claimed to speak for him. Often it was hard for people to discern the difference between true and false prophets, especially since false prophets usually told them what they wanted to hear (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.10-14">1 Kgs 22:10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-4">Jer 28:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Because of this difficulty, and the Lord’s merciful delay in bringing judgment upon his rebellious people, many people doubted that God’s word through his true prophets would ever be fulfilled (see <a href="?bref=Isa.5.19">Isa 5:19</a>). Others denied that anything would happen within their lifetimes. Might not the punishment that had so often been delayed be delayed a little longer?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Ezekiel prophesied that in the coming judgment upon Jerusalem, false prophets would be cut off so that people would no longer be confused about who the true prophets were (<a href="?bref=Ezek.13.8-9">Ezek 13:8-9</a>). There would also be no more delay to God’s judgment—the Lord was coming very soon to fulfill the words he had spoken (<a href="?bref=Ezek.13.11">13:11</a>). Everyone would see which words God had really spoken and which words the false prophets had conjured out of their own imaginations.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus warned of the presence of false prophets in the future (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.11-28">Matt 24:11-28</a>), and his early followers encountered numerous false prophets (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.13.6-12">Acts 13:6-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1-3">2 Pet 2:1-3</a>). Believers can often recognize false prophets by their incorrect teaching about Christ, which demonstrates that they are not operating under the Spirit of God (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1-3">1 Jn 4:1-3</a>).</p>

<title>Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility</title>
<refs>Ezek.14.9-11</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Bible ultimately traces all things back to God’s sovereignty. For example, the fact that the rain falls on the just and unjust alike is part of God’s sovereign plan (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.45">Matt 5:45</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">At the same time, God is in no way responsible for our sin; it is our responsibility because it comes from our own sinful desires. Scripture repeatedly demonstrates that people have the ability to choose to follow God or to reject him (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.30.15-20">Deut 30:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.15">Josh 24:15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.12">John 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.9-13">Rom 10:9-13</a>). God does not coerce people to have faith in him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Ezekiel 14:9-11 describes an intriguing situation in which God deceives a prophet but then also holds that same prophet accountable for his actions. This leads to a difficult question: How can we reconcile God’s sovereign control over all things with the personal choices and decisions for which we will be called to account?</p>
<p class="theme-body">In giving misleading messages to false prophets, God was simply giving them and their hearers exactly what they wanted (cp. <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.11">2 Thes 2:11</a>). Even a false prophet could give a prophecy that led people astray only with the Lord’s permission or direction. Unless God restrained them from their sin, they would choose lies instead of the truth and worship creation in place of the Creator (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-25">Rom 1:18-25</a>). God simply gave them permission to enact their hearts’ sinful desires.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The remarkable fact is not that God allows some sinners to persist in their chosen delusions, but that he saves sinners, changes our natures, and gives us the desire to do good for his glory (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25-26">Ezek 36:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-11">Rom 8:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.10">Eph 2:10</a>). While we may not be able to completely reconcile this complex tension, we can be assured of the freely offered grace of God and the new life that he gives through his Spirit to all who trust in him.</p>

<title>Messages against the Nations</title>
<refs>Ezek.25.1-32.32</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Messages against the Nations</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Why would Israel’s prophets address discourses to nations who in all likelihood would never hear the messages uttered against them? Why were the prophets concerned about what these nations thought and did?</p>
<p class="theme-body">It was because the real audience was the people of God. These messages reminded God’s people that God does not operate on a double standard, judging the sins of his own people while the nations around them were free to act as they wished. Though judgment begins with God’s own household (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.17">1 Pet 4:17</a>), it certainly does not end there. God will judge all, both inside and outside Israel, who rebel against him and his reign. All must come to acknowledge the Lord as the one true and sovereign God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The people of Judah were inclined to trust some of these nations (such as Egypt) to rescue them from foreign oppressors—not realizing that God was using other nations to bring judgment upon his people. The prophets reminded the people that no nation on earth can be trusted in place of God. In the end, all nations will bow before him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The messages against the foreign nations also reminded the covenant community that in spite of God’s judgment on them because of their sin, they were still his precious people. The primary accusation against these foreign nations was that they had persecuted and insulted God’s chosen people and had thereby affronted God. The negative side of God’s covenant with Abraham was still in force: “I will . . . curse those who treat you with contempt” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gen 12:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s consistent purpose in history is to bring glory to himself. By exiling his sinful people and by judging their arrogant oppressors, God displayed his power and holiness. Yet, in spite of the Exile, there was still hope for the positive side of the covenant to be fulfilled: “All the families on earth will be blessed through you” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gen 12:3</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.11.1-27">Rom 11:1-27</a>). God’s purposes for his people were not exhausted; he would ultimately bring glory to himself by bringing them back from the distant lands to which they had been scattered.</p>

<title>The Promise of New Life</title>
<refs>Ezek.37.1-28</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Promise of New Life</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Resurrection is a core tenet of Christian faith—without it, our faith is useless (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.14">1 Cor 15:14</a>). God has promised that we share this resurrection with Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.3.1">Col 3:1</a>), and it is important to rightly understand exactly what new life God promises to us.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">Ezekiel 37</a> might at first appear to teach that all people will be resurrected from the dead, living again in new bodies after their present bodies die. However, Ezekiel is not dealing with the general question, “Can human bones return to life?” Ezekiel and his audience were already familiar with the possibility of dead people being raised to life because of their knowledge of the miracles of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.17-24">1 Kgs 17:17-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.31-37">2 Kgs 4:31-37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.20-21">13:20-21</a>). Instead, Ezekiel is addressing the particular question, “Can <span class="ital">these</span> bones live?” That is, could the nation of Judah—a denuded, dismembered, and desiccated nation—be restored?</p>
<p class="theme-body">At that time, the Babylonians had devastated Judah, the Temple had been destroyed, and many of the people had been exiled to Babylon. The people still in Judah were a mere remnant, only the poorest of the poor (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.8-12">2 Kgs 25:8-12</a>). Many concluded that there was no future for God’s people. They said, “We have become old, dry bones—all hope is gone. Our nation is finished” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.11">Ezek 37:11</a>). The question was not whether God <span class="ital">could</span> raise them to new life, but whether he <span class="ital">would</span> perform such a miracle for the dry bones that represented Israel.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The prophet answered this question with a resounding <span class="ital">Yes!</span> God would return his people to life through an outpouring of his Spirit in response to the prophet’s word. Their death because of their sins was real, but God would not leave them in the grave (cp. <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Ps 16:10</a>). Rather, he promised that in the future he would give his people life by his Spirit and would transform them into a new creation, a new Spirit-filled Israel. This new people of God would be raised to their feet as a mighty army that would serve the Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God is capable of raising to life both those who are physically dead and those who are spiritually dead. He chooses to give the miracle of new birth to undeserving sinners (see <a href="?bref=John.3.5-7">John 3:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.1-7">Eph 2:1-7</a>). Those who experience the death of sin in their lives also experience the new life that God offers through his Spirit—both now and in eternity (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.5-13">Rom 8:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-11">Col 3:1-11</a>). He makes people whom the world would write off as irredeemable acceptable to himself in Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>), and he equips them for fruitful work in his service (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.12-13">Eph 4:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.11-18">6:11-18</a>).</p>

<title>Apocalyptic Literature</title>
<refs>Ezek.38.1-39.24</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Apocalyptic Literature</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Several Old Testament passages (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.1-27.13">Isa 24–27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.1-39.29">Ezek 38:1–39:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">Dan 7–12</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">Zech 9–14</a>) have elements that are similar to later Jewish apocalyptic literature. The entire book of Revelation in the New Testament also fits into this literary genre. Apocalyptic literature focuses on visions as the means of communication (the term <span class="ital">apocalyptic</span> comes from the Greek term <span class="greek">apokalupsis</span>, meaning “revelation”). Other types of prophetic literature, by contrast, put the central focus on the words of the message. To put it in courtroom terms, whereas the prophet delivering an oracle is like the prosecuting counsel, the writer of apocalyptic literature is acting as a witness, describing the heavenly realities that he has seen.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Another difference is that prophecy normally looks forward to salvation or judgment within the boundaries of this present world. Apocalyptic literature, by contrast, looks for a fulfillment that transcends space and time. It does not hold out hope for a gradual improvement in society; rather, it foresees a cosmic event that will bring existing realities to an end and replace them with a new reality. Apocalyptic literature has a negative view of the present time, which is often described as a time of conflict between light and darkness. There can be neither compromise nor peaceful coexistence between the supernatural forces of good and the forces of darkness and rebellion. Apocalyptic literature opens the door on the normally unseen elements of this battle between light and darkness. The reality and presence of spiritual darkness becomes particularly evident, but so do the unseen forces of good all around us, which will ultimately triumph. This future triumph is seen as fixed and certain, no matter what human or spiritual forces attempt to frustrate it.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Apocalyptic visions have a consistent purpose, which is to encourage and exhort the faithful, particularly in times of tribulation. The good news of apocalyptic literature is that even though the present looks bleak, the outcome of the decisive battle has already been determined, and the forces of light will have the ultimate victory. Apocalyptic literature acts as a corrective to pagan propaganda, which proclaims that the status quo will continue unchanged and unchallenged, and it responds with a proclamation of its own: God reigns, and his Kingdom will ultimately triumph. This news encourages the faithful during the present times of suffering and difficulty but also exhorts them to continue being faithful, no matter what the opposition. It proclaims a theology of hope to the marginalized: God is on the throne and he will ultimately triumph. In the meantime, whatever the cost in terms of suffering, obedience is the only way to live while we look forward with hope to our final vindication, when God will act decisively to bring in his new age of salvation.</p>

<title>Temple Architecture as Theology</title>
<refs>Ezek.40.1-43.27</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Temple Architecture as Theology</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Temple plan given in <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-43.27">Ezekiel 40–43</a> does not seem physically buildable, nor was it intended to be. The details given in the plan are not sufficient to guide construction, as can be seen from the varying diagrams created by scholars. The materials to be used are not specified, as they were in great detail for the Tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.10-40.33">Exod 25:10–40:33</a>). Neither is there evidence that any attempt was made later to build the Second Temple according to this plan. Thus, Ezekiel’s plan for the Temple is evidently not a blueprint for future construction.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Instead, Ezekiel’s Temple vision is a theological statement in the form of an architectural plan. The vision’s message is intended to shame Ezekiel’s generation for their past and motivate them to be faithful in the future (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.10-12">Ezek 43:10-12</a>). The vision describes a new world in which boundaries between the holy and the unholy are established and standards are raised, so that God may return to his Temple to dwell among his people once again (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.3-4">10:3-4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.22-23">11:22-23</a>). Access to the realm of the holy is considerably restricted. Those who were faithful in the past are granted renewed access, while those who had been unfaithful are marginalized. There is a deepened interest in the sacrifices of atonement and purification for the people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This grand, new Temple points to Jesus Christ, in whom God’s glory is revealed. His body was a temple that was to be torn down and then built back up in three days (<a href="?bref=John.2.19">John 2:19</a>). In Jesus, the light of God’s holiness shone out clearly in the darkness, and the darkness was not able to extinguish it (<a href="?bref=John.1.5">John 1:5</a>). His body was the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice that purified the people (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.12">Heb 10:12</a>). Those who are in Christ now have the privilege of access through him to the heavenly Most Holy Place in the new Jerusalem. Its doors stand permanently open to those who have washed their robes and made them clean in the blood of the Lamb (see <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">Rev 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.14">22:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Since we have been united to Christ and have become part of his body, the new temple, how can we live any longer as we once did? The Holy Spirit dwells in us, and our bodies no longer belong to ourselves but to him as parts of his new temple (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15-20">1 Cor 6:15-20</a>). A holy life is the mark of God’s children (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13-16">1 Pet 1:13-16</a>).</p>

<refs>Ezek.43.18-46.24</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Temple Legislation as Theology</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The rabbis of Judaism spent a great deal of time seeking to harmonize the laws of <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.1-48.35">Ezekiel 44–48</a> with the laws of the Torah. They were unsuccessful because the legislation in these chapters was no more intended to match that of Moses than the vision of the Temple building (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-43.27">Ezek 40–43</a>) was designed to match the design of the Tabernacle or the Temple of Solomon. The description of the Temple regulations conveys a theological message of change, as did the earlier description of the Temple’s architecture.</p>
<p class="theme-body">These regulations highlighted the need for proper separation between the Temple and the palace. The sacrificial rituals would become more numerous and more focused on purification. Holy offerings would once again be made by holy people to the holy God. These practices were completely devoted to the separation of the holy from the unholy and to the cleansing of God’s people. Since defilement of the Temple and idolatrous worship had driven the Lord out of his house (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1-11.25">Ezek 8–11</a>), an entirely new situation was necessary if God was to dwell once more among his people. Thus, the function of this legislation was to convict the prophet’s hearers of their past abuses that had broken down the wall of separation between the holy and the unholy and to reassure them that God would restore his people’s worship to its proper state.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This legislation also puts the prince, the king descended from David, in a proper place of submission to the Lord. This element finds fulfillment with the coming of Christ. Jesus came as a servant King who delighted to do the Father’s will (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1-11">Matt 4:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.25-28">20:25-28</a>). He offered the perfect purification offering, cleansed the heavenly sanctuary once for all time (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.11-12">Heb 9:11-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.9.23">23</a>), and ensured that God could dwell in the midst of his people forever. His blood cleanses us of all sin and enables sinners to boldly enter the heavenly Most Holy Place without fear of rejection or reprisal.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Israel’s Geography as Theology</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The division of the land in <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.13-48.35">Ezekiel 47:13–48:35</a> combines spiritual ideals with a practical message that reinforces themes from earlier sections of the vision (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-46.24">Ezek 40–46</a>). The prophet Ezekiel saw a future with strong links to the past, for the land of Israel was still the special land that had been promised to the patriarchs.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The map in this vision does not resemble the earlier tribal patchwork established in Joshua’s time. In Ezekiel’s vision, each tribe would receive an equal portion of the land, arranged in east-to-west strips that oriented the whole land on the same axis as the Temple at its center. These strips of land bear no connection to the actual geographic features of the land—they are not intended to be understood physically. The point seems to be that the old tribal jealousies and hatreds will be gone, as each tribe is on exactly the same footing as the others.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The monarchy is not abolished in this vision, but it is transformed. The defiled city that was destroyed in the earlier chapters of Ezekiel gives way to a new holy city of unity and harmony for the tribes. A life-giving river does its work of restoration, bringing the blessing that flows from God’s Temple to bear on every aspect of the people’s lives.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The whole vision of <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ezekiel 40–48</a> encourages the prophet’s hearers to repent of their past sins, to be faithful in the often-difficult present, and to hope for a brighter future through God’s power and grace. The closing chapters of the book of Revelation present this vision as fulfilled in Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">Rev 21–22</a>). Jesus inaugurated the spiritual reality that Ezekiel described—a heavenly city “designed and built by God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.10">Heb 11:10</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Four World Empires</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Two panoramic visions in Daniel present God’s sovereignty over history. Nebuchadnezzar had the first vision (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">2</a>), and Daniel had another like it (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">7</a>). In each of these visions, four of the kingdoms of the world are presented.</p>
<p class="theme-body">There have always been questions about the identities of the four empires, but historically there has also been considerable consensus. Hippolytus (<span class="era">AD</span> 170–236), one of the early church fathers, identified the four kingdoms as Babylonia, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome. The church father and historian Eusebius of Caesarea (<span class="era">AD</span> 260–340) initially identified the first kingdom as Assyria (which once also controlled Babylon), but he later agreed with Hippolytus, as did most of the church fathers. Later, Jerome and Augustine accepted this same understanding, and conservative interpreters largely still agree.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In antiquity and in our era, some interpreters have argued that Greece is the fourth empire, treating Media and Persia as separate kingdoms. This interpretation is due in part to denying the possibility of prediction, assuming the book was written before the Roman Empire had arisen. But Media and Persia are usually regarded as one empire, and the Median kingdom had been mostly assimilated by the Persians by the time Cyrus II conquered Babylon in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Rome is then seen as the fourth kingdom, but the bestial, demonic, and inhumane characteristics of the vision extend beyond the historical Rome. The visions also represent a panorama of the whole world and its governments; all will be destroyed and replaced by the Kingdom of God, the “rock . . . cut from a mountain” (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.34">2:34</a>). The metals of the statue become progressively less valuable in chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">2</a>, while the animal imagery of chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">7</a> becomes more menacingly fierce, violent, and inhumane. These features represent a deterioration of human civilization across the centuries, even as the Kingdom of God grows in power and stature (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.35">2:35</a>).</p>

<title>The Little Horn</title>
<refs>Dan.7.8-27</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Little Horn</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The little horn in Daniel’s vision stands for a king; it has personal features such as human eyes and a mouth. This imagery is characteristic of apocalyptic literature. The little horn captures Daniel’s attention because of its “boastful speech” and its violent actions against other kings, God’s people, and the Most High.</p>
<p class="theme-body">What or who is the little horn? The little horn of <a href="?bref=Dan.7.8">Daniel 7:8</a> is closely tied to the figures of evil in <a href="?bref=Dan.9.27">9:27</a> and <a href="?bref=Dan.11.40-45">11:40-45</a>. Antiochus IV Epiphanes (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.9-14">8:9-14</a>, <a href="?bref=Dan.8.23-25">23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.21-39">11:21-39</a>) has characteristics similar to the little horn of <a href="?bref=Dan.7.8">7:8</a>, but they do not appear to be identical. Ancient and modern interpreters have held that the little horn is the Antichrist to come. Some maintain that certain historical persons of the Greek and Roman empires have preliminarily fulfilled the vision (e.g., Antiochus IV Epiphanes, Nero, Caligula, Domitian). According to this view, this being yet to come will be a man, not a demon or Satan.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It is also helpful to see the little horn as representing the embodiment of evil that is directed against God and his people. Some interpreters believe that no single man will fulfill this vision, but that the vision represents the evil forces at work in the world. Others hold that the Antichrist has already come. The idea of the Antichrist does seem to have an ultimate fulfillment, as suggested by the New Testament (see <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-12">2 Thes 2:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1">Rev 13:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.13.5">5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.13-14">16:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.11">17:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.20-21">19:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10">20:10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Regardless, this little horn reminds God’s people that evil violently opposes God and his people. The king described here usurps the kingdoms of this world (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.8">Dan 7:8</a>), but his demonic system will not prevail because evil will be destroyed. God’s people can take comfort in knowing that this onslaught and manifestation of evil will be short lived (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.12">Rev 12:12</a>) and the works of this hellish kingdom will be demolished (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.11-12">Dan 7:11-12</a>). God’s chosen leader, the one “like a son of man” installed by the Ancient One (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">7:13-14</a>), will rule by God’s divine approval and power, and his reign will prevail in an indestructible kingdom. God’s people are encouraged to endure and be faithful.

<title>The Seventy Sets of Seven</title>

<p class="theme-title">The Seventy Sets of Seven</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The seventy sevens (or weeks) of <a href="?bref=Dan.9.24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</a> have always puzzled students of the Bible. Although difficult to assign to a precise period of history, the seventy sets of seven are significant: They demonstrate God’s sovereignty over history and emphasize his ability to bring his plans for his people to completion. The number seventy (seven times ten) represents completeness. For example, the seventy years of exile for God’s people (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.2">9:2</a>) were enough to chastise them. The two main interpretations of the seventy sets of seven are presented here.</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp">SCENARIO A: THE REIGN OF ANTIOCHUS IV (175–163 <span class="era">BC</span>).)  The seventy sets of seven refer to history from Cyrus II of Persia (539 <span class="era">BC</span>; see <a href="?bref=Dan.9.25">9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezra 1:2-4</a>) to Antiochus IV (175–163 <span class="era">BC</span>; see <a href="?bref=Dan.8.23-25">Dan 8:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.21-39">11:21-39</a>). In this scenario, the “Anointed One” was the high priest Onias III, and the “ruler” (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.26-27">9:26-27</a>) was Antiochus IV, whose treaty with the people of Judea in 174 <span class="era">BC</span> was supposed to allow them to practice their faith peacefully. In 170 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antiochus attacked Jerusalem, killed many, and looted the Temple. Then in 167 <span class="era">BC</span> he put an end to the sacrifices and offerings, forced the Jews to stop practicing their faith on pain of death, and desecrated the Temple with a “sacrilegious object”: He placed a statue of Zeus on the altar of burnt offering, where he sacrificed pigs and other unclean animals (cp. <a href="?bref=Dan.11.21-35">11:21-35</a>). Antiochus was struck with a painful disease, and he died in 163 <span class="era">BC</span>—“The fate decreed for this defiler” was “finally poured out on him” (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.27">9:27</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Dan.8.25">8:25</a>; <span class="ital">1 Maccabees</span> 1:10-24; 6:7-16; <span class="ital">2 Maccabees</span> 9:1-29). In Scenario A, when Jesus spoke of the “sacrilegious object that causes desecration,” he was referring to the Jews’ experience in the time of Antiochus as a paradigm of the things that would happen in the future (see <a href="?bref=Matt.24.15">Matt 24:15</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.21.20">Luke 21:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-4">2 Thes 2:3-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp">SCENARIO B: THE DEATH OF CHRIST (<span class="era">AD</span> 30 or 33).  The seventy weeks are a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, the anointed Messiah. In this scenario, the “seventy sets of seven” began either with the decree of Cyrus (538 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) or with one of the decrees of Artaxerxes (458 or 445 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.8-26">Ezra 7:8-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1-10">Neh 2:1-10</a>). The death of Christ then occurred either at the end of sixty-nine sets of seven (seven plus sixty-two, <a href="?bref=Dan.9.25-26">Dan 9:25-26</a>) or at the midpoint of the seventieth (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.27">9:27</a>). These two options have implications for how the seventy sets of seven are brought to completion. In the first option, the seventieth set of seven is seen as a future time not yet fulfilled. In the second option, the seventieth set of seven is seen as having been completed when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. If the decree of Cyrus is seen as the starting point, the 490 years are symbolic. However, if the decree given to Nehemiah to rebuild the city (445 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">Neh 2:1</a>) is taken as the starting point (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.25">Dan 9:25</a>), then there were very nearly 483 years (69 x 7 years) between that date and the death of Christ in <span class="era">AD</span> 30 or 33.</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="ital">Option 1: The Seventieth Set of Seven Remains to Be Fulfilled in the Future.</span>  Many interpreters have argued that Christ’s death occurred at the end of the sixty-ninth set of seven, and the seventieth set of seven is yet to be fulfilled. In that case, there is now a long gap from the sixty-ninth set of seven to the seventieth. The seventieth still lies in the future and corresponds to the reign of the Antichrist during the tribulation at the end of history (see <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-12">2 Thes 2:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18-22">1 Jn 2:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1">Rev 13:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.13.5">5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.13-14">16:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.11">17:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.20-21">19:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10">20:10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="ital">Option 2: The Seventieth Set of Seven Was Completed When Rome Destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple.</span>  Other interpreters have held that the seventy weeks were fulfilled with the coming of Christ, his death and resurrection, and the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. In this case, Christ began his ministry at the end of the sixty-ninth set of seven, around <span class="era">AD</span> 28. He ministered for approximately three and a half years, then was killed in the middle of the seventieth seven. The remaining half-seven ended when the “ruler”—one or more of the Roman rulers—destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. The war and its miseries now continue between God’s people and the kingdom of this world to the very end, when Christ will return, judge the wicked, and establish his Kingdom.</p>

<title>Resurrection in the Old Testament</title>
<refs>Dan.12.1-3</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Resurrection in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Many Old Testament passages suggest that the realm of the dead is a place from which people do not return (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Job.7.6-21">Job 7:6-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.6.5">Ps 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.18-19">Isa 38:18-19</a>). Yet some passages do seem to hint at the notion of resurrection (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">Job 19:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.12.1-3">Ps 16:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.19">Isa 26:19</a>). <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1-3">Daniel 12:1-3</a> clearly teaches that the dead will be resurrected, and Daniel was told that he would be raised in this resurrection (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.13">12:13</a>). Belief in the resurrection of the dead became more widespread during the intertestamental period, as evidenced by the popularity of this notion in the time of Jesus.</p>
<p class="theme-body">According to this passage from Daniel, the resurrection will not be the same for all people. Two distinct groups of people will be raised: (a) those resurrected to experience new life and (b) those resurrected to experience shame. These two groups are distinguished by moral, ethical, and spiritual characteristics. The resurrection will unveil the true nature of a person, and there will be an ethical and spiritual accounting to God Most High.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The first group will experience a new existence called “everlasting life.” The expression is found only here in the Old Testament, and it seems to refer here more to the quality of life than to its length. Those who experience this life are refined, cleansed, and made pure before their God. The moral and ethical glory of those resurrected in Daniel’s first group is indicated by the metaphors “shine as bright as the sky” and “shine like the stars forever.” The second group experiences everlasting shame and disgrace instead of everlasting life because they are not morally, ethically, or spiritually renewed. The New Testament book of Revelation expands upon these two groups of Daniel’s vision (see <a href="?bref=Rev.20.4-6">Rev 20:4-6</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.20.11-15">11-15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s people will finally be rescued from death. Those who are raised to life have had their names inscribed in the Book of Life (see <a href="?bref=Dan.7.9-10">Dan 7:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.21">10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12">Rev 20:12</a>), and the Judge—the Ancient One—approves of them.</p>

<title>Knowing God</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Knowing God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">From our perspective, knowledge tends to mean information, facts, and concepts. But in biblical times, knowledge was centered in personal relationships. To know someone is to enter into a close relationship with that person. Knowing God involves much more than simply mastering facts and information about him. It even transcends discussions about the nature and character of God, as important as those are. Knowing God means entering into a close relationship with him. It means viewing everything as God does and learning to imitate him. Knowing God will transform our thoughts and actions, our priorities and values, and our relationships with fellow human beings. It is far more important than religious rites, sacrifices and burnt offerings, or any other religious activities (see <a href="?bref=Jer.9.23-24">Jer 9:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.34">31:34</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The prophet Hosea strongly emphasizes the importance of knowing God. He demonstrates that Israel would ultimately be destroyed (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.6">Hos 4:6</a>) because they did not know God (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.1">4:1</a>). This theme of knowing God is also prevalent in the New Testament Gospel of John. Jesus repeatedly stresses the need to know God, affirming that people can be heavily involved in religious practice but have no genuine relationship with God (see <a href="?bref=John.7.25-29">John 7:25-29</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.14-19">8:14-19</a>, <a href="?bref=John.8.54-55">54-55</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.6-11">14:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.1-3">17:1-3</a>).</p>

<title>Social Justice</title>
<refs>Amos.2.6-8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Social Justice</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the Old Testament, prophets often confronted evil in society and articulated a demand for social justice. An early example of this is found in Elijah’s response to the murder of Naboth, followed by his rebuke of Ahab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.16-24">1 Kgs 21:16-24</a>, 800s <span class="era">BC</span>). The social aspect of the prophetic message became even more prominent among the prophets of the 700s <span class="era">BC</span> (Hosea and Amos in Israel, Micah and Isaiah in Judah), with Amos as the most articulate spokesman on this issue.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Amos was appalled by Israel’s abuse of the powerless (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-8">Amos 2:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.3.10">3:10</a>). Unlike the surrounding nations, Israel had known God in a uniquely personal and intimate manner and then turned away from him (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.9-12">2:9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.3.1-2">3:1-2</a>). The people of Israel had refused to worship God appropriately and had oppressed the powerless, so God would hold them accountable and meet them in judgment (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.12">4:12</a>), not mercy. God wants justice to flow like a mighty river (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.24">Amos 5:24</a>). Those who oppose it will be swept away.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The importance of social justice is also made clear in the New Testament. Jesus drew a connection between proper worship and the practice of social justice, warning of the judgment that is coming upon those who do not express their faith in loving action toward others (see <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Matt 25:31-46</a>). Right understanding must be matched by right practice, which serves as evidence of one’s faith (see <a href="?bref=Luke.10.25-37">Luke 10:25-37</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.35">John 13:35</a>). Jesus’ followers recoginzed the significant role social justice needed to play within the early Christian communities (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.44-45">Acts 2:44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.9-10">Gal 2:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.3-16">1 Tim 5:3-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.27-2.26">Jas 1:27–2:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.17-19">1 Jn 3:17-19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s compassion for the oppressed is evidenced throughout Scripture. As followers of Christ, we must not neglect those who are in need, and like the prophets, we must confront injustice wherever it is encountered.</p>

<title>Worship in Jerusalem</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Worship in Jerusalem</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Old Testament prophets realized that genuine worship depends on a proper understanding of God and his requirements. God had determined that the Temple in Jerusalem would be the central location of worship for his people. The Lord roared from Zion and thundered from Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.2">1:2</a>). It was unacceptable for the Israelites to set up a central worship site in any place other than his authorized Temple in Jerusalem. But after the Israelite kingdom divided, the king of the north, Jeroboam, established alternative worship centers and discouraged his people from going to Jerusalem to worship. Over time, various worship sites were constructed—in the north and the south. But no matter how many sacrifices were offered or how elaborate the rituals performed there (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.4-5">5:4-5</a>), these were not the places for worship God had chosen.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the New Testament, worship is no longer tied to a particular location; worship may occur wherever believers choose to gather (see <a href="?bref=Matt.18.20">Matt 18:20</a>). But it must be conducted as God directs: “in spirit and in truth” (<a href="?bref=John.4.23-24">John 4:23-24</a>). In both the Old and New Testaments, an emphasis is placed upon the authenticity of worship.</p>

<refs>Amos.1.3-3.2</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Sovereignty over All Nations</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the ancient world, nations often considered religion in terms of a national god or gods. The king of Aram, for example, believed Israel’s “gods” were tied to the hills and would not be able to act elsewhere (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.23">1 Kgs 20:23</a>). Jephthah demonstrated a pagan heritage by saying that the god Chemosh had given the Ammonites their land (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.24">Judg 11:24</a>). The prophet Amos, by contrast, knew that God alone had brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Amos 9:7</a>). God had created the entire cosmos, not just Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.13">4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.8">5:8</a>), so he was perfectly justified in requiring that nations conduct their affairs with justice and mercy (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2">1:3–2:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">One heresy prevalent among the people of Judah and Israel was that, in spite of their sinfulness, God would eventually vindicate them because of his covenant with them (see <a href="?bref=Jer.7.4">Jer 7:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.3.1-2">Amos 3:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.10">9:10</a>). They developed a false theology of the day of the Lord: They thought that God’s intervention in history automatically meant deliverance for them and destruction for their enemies. Amos directly confronted this false notion of privilege (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">9:7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-20">5:18-20</a>). The day of the Lord would not absolve sinful Israel; rather, God would use it to punish them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Israel’s position of privilege among the nations made them more responsible, not less. While the surrounding nations would be punished for their particularly grievous sins, Israel would be punished for all their sins (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.2">3:2</a>). The New Testament further develops this theme of the greater responsibility of God’s people: Those who receive much are responsible for much (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.48">Luke 12:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.1">Jas 3:1</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">What Is Good</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">Micah 6:8</a>, a well-known and oft-memorized verse, answers a series of questions put forth by a confused people who had lost their moral and spiritual bearings.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The people of Israel wanted to know what they could do to be acceptable to the Lord. In an oppressive and deceitful society, they had lost their sense of what the Lord regards as good. God gave them a concrete answer: He is not seeking mechanical, ritualistic worship (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.6-7">6:6-7</a>), but that his people do what is right in relationship with him and in their relationships with each other. As they are motivated by love, their actions will be marked by justice, mercy, and humility. God’s people are not to oppress others, but to do what is just, righteous, and honest toward one another.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">Micah 6:8</a> summarizes what God had already made known in the past to Israel: Humility, faith, and obedience are pleasing to him. God declared this message to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gen 15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">17:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.17.9">9</a>), to Moses at Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-23.33">Exod 20–23</a>), through his prophets (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.6.1-8">Deut 6:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.6">Hos 6:6</a>), and through Israel’s wise men (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">Prov 1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">It pleases God when his people walk humbly in faith before him, as exemplified by Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.12.3">Num 12:3</a>), Habakkuk (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.17-19">Hab 3:17-19</a>), Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.1-19">Dan 9:1-19</a>), and Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.5-15">Ezra 9:5-15</a>). Real spirituality and devotion result in doing good, seeking justice, relieving oppression, defending orphans, and aiding widows (see <a href="?bref=Exod.22.21-24">Exod 22:21-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.2-12">23:2-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.4-11">Deut 15:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.12-15">24:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-13">Neh 5:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.16">Jer 22:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.27">Dan 4:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.7-24">Amos 5:7-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.27">Jas 1:27</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Human Perplexity and God’s Purpose</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God is not an absent deity, or one who only intervenes on a rare occasion. He is intimately involved and active in what comes to pass in this world so that everything might work toward his purpose (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.3">2:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Hab.2.14">14</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.47.9">Ps 47:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.24-26">Acts 17:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Col 1:15-20</a>). The Lord is a holy and merciful God who acts in history to redeem his people (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.2-15">Hab 3:2-15</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Eph.1.3-10">Eph 1:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.15">2 Pet 3:15</a>) so that all may ultimately see his glory (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.14">Hab 2:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">But often the ways in which God works out his purposes are confusing to his people. Such perplexity is evidenced in the prophetic book of Habakkuk. Habakkuk had a candid relationship with God: The prophet felt free to bring his honest concerns to the Lord, and God did not rebuke him for doing so. From Habakkuk’s perspective, God seemed inactive in the face of the violence and social injustice plaguing Judah (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.2-4">Hab 1:2-4</a>). God then revealed that he would take action: He was going to raise up the Babylonians—a nation even more wicked than Judah—to punish Judah (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.5-11">1:5-11</a>). This further perplexed Habakkuk. Yet God’s assurance that justice would be done, along with a vision of God’s glory, brought the prophet to settled faith and praise (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.16-19">3:16-19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Habakkuk’s journey is similar to that of most believers. When times of doubt and discouragement come, believers can approach the Lord and pour out their questions and concerns to him. He may not provide all the answers, and the answers he does provide may not be what we want to hear. But like Habakkuk, we may receive a fresh glimpse of who God is and what he is like, which will enable us to renew our trust in the One who is in control.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Spiritual Renewal in the Later Prophets</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Haggai repeatedly charged his audience to reflect on how their current situation resulted from neglecting their relationship with God (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.5-7">Hag 1:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.15-18">2:15-18</a>).

Haggai recognized that spiritual renewal had to accompany the physical reconstruction of the Temple (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.12">1:12</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The theme of spiritual renewal helps tie the postexilic prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi together. God had indeed brought his people back to their land, as he had promised through the earlier prophets. But the people still needed to attend to their spiritual condition, or they would face additional difficulties. The continuing prospect of failure to obey God during the postexilic period highlights the need for the appearance of the Lord’s “servant” (see <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.23">Hag 2:23</a>, initially applied to Zerubbabel but later interpreted as pointing to the Messiah). A righteous shepherd-king was coming (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zech 9:9</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">Mal 3:1</a>). God’s presence among his people would return in a definitive way, creation would be restored, and worship of the Lord would be universal.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Returning to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Old Testament prophets often communicated—both before and after the Exile—the need for the people of Israel to return to the Lord (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.55.6-7">Isa 55:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.1-3">Hos 6:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.12">Hag 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.7">Mal 3:7</a>). Their abandonment of the true God—and their turning toward other gods—precipitated his judgment, which culminated in the destruction of the Temple and exile from their land. The future restoration and blessing of God’s people was dependent on their returning to him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This is the core message of Zechariah to those returning to Jerusalem from exile, as seen in his opening statement: “Return to me, and I will return to you, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies” (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.3">Zech 1:3</a>). Zechariah’s call to repentance was a call for the people of Israel to renew their commitment to their covenant relationship with God. Zechariah warned his audience to learn from their ancestors’ past violation of the covenant, which had devastating consequences (<a href="?bref=Zech.7.11-14">7:11-14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Zechariah’s interest in Israel’s covenant relationship with God extended to issues of social justice. Returning to the Lord leads naturally to obedience and to the practice of justice, honesty, fairness, mercy, and kindness (<a href="?bref=Zech.7.9-10">7:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.16-17">8:16-17</a>). Zechariah’s concern for right relationship with God and others anticipated Jesus’ later teaching on the most important commandments: to love God above all, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.34-40">Matt 22:34-40</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Return of God’s Presence with His People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The descriptions of the Exile include the tragedy that, as part of his judgment, God withdrew his presence from his people and from the holy city of Jerusalem. This notion is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in a vision of the prophet Ezekiel, who saw a visual depiction of God’s glorious presence leaving the Temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">Ezek 10:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.22-23">11:22-23</a>). As such, when the prophets discussed the future restoration of God’s people and their return to the land, they also often spoke of the return of God’s presence (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.52.7-8">Isa 52:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-9">Ezek 43:1-9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The prophet Zechariah placed a strong emphasis on this theme of the Lord returning to his people. He was certain that God would once again live among them and that the glory of the Lord would rest in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.16">1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.5">2:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Zech.2.10-11">10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.3">8:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Zech.8.23">23</a>). God’s presence would return with the rebuilding of the Temple, and Israel would experience spiritual restoration and renewed agricultural bounty (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.17">1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.8-9">4:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.15">6:15</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.19">Hag 2:19</a>). In the future, God’s presence would rescue Jerusalem and the people of Israel from enemy nations. The Lord would be enthroned as King over all the earth, and the whole earth would worship the one true God (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.16">Zech 9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.6">10:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.9">12:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.9">14:9</a>). In both the present and the future, the return of the Lord’s presence to Jerusalem was connected with the enabling work of God’s Spirit (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.6">4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.10">12:10</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.5">Hag 2:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Zechariah’s promise of the Lord’s presence in Jerusalem anticipated the coming of Jesus the Messiah and the awesome mystery of the Word of God becoming human and living on earth among us (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">God’s Commitment to His People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Sometimes, from the perspective of God’s people, it seems that God is being slow to fulfill his promises. Abraham and Sarah had to wait twenty-five years from the time God first promised to make of them a great nation until their son Isaac was born. After God promised the kingship to David, David had to endure many trials under the reign of Saul before God finally established him as king. And though God had promised to bring a remnant back to the Promised Land after the Exile, the Jewish captives had to wait seventy years to return. Yet in each case, God indeed brought about the fulfillment of his promises.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Zechariah prophesied around the time that the Temple was being rebuilt after the Exile. At one point during the reconstruction, God told Zechariah not to “despise these small beginnings” (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.10">Zech 4:10</a>). God had acted in the past for the ultimate good of his people, even in the exile to Babylon (see <a href="?bref=Zech.7.12-14">7:12-14</a>). God would accomplish his purposes for Israel’s well-being in his own time and his own way. The people of Israel could take courage in the present and have hope for the future because God keeps his word and fulfills his promises (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.9">4:9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God wants patience and faith from his people, not a strident voice. God kept his word and fulfilled the promises he made indicating that his people would return to Jerusalem and that the Temple would be rebuilt. About five hundred years after Zechariah, God fulfilled the promises that he would bring salvation for all people, by sending Jesus the Messiah into the world. Likewise, Jesus’ words that he will one day return and fully establish his Kingdom can be trusted (see <a href="?bref=Matt.24.27">Matt 24:27</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">30</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-11">Acts 1:6-11</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-body-fl">The prophet Malachi’s message to the people of Israel begins, “‘I have always loved you,’ says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.2">Mal 1:2</a>). Indeed, God’s love for Israel is evidenced throughout the Old Testament. Malachi’s call to examine the events of history for evidence of God’s love and power connects his book to the larger story of salvation in the Bible. The psalmist, for instance, boldly proclaims the glorious deeds of the Lord to the next generation, so that each generation might “set its hope anew on God, . . . obeying his commands” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.2-4">Ps 78:2-4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.78.7">7</a>). The touchstone for God’s activity in Old Testament history was the exodus from Egypt (see <a href="?bref=Ps.78.12-13">Pss 78:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.26-38">105:26-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.7-12">106:7-12</a>). Israel commemorated that event annually in the Festival of Passover and included a catechism for instructing the next generation in the mighty deeds of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-13.22">Exod 12–13</a>), so that they would always remember his loving action toward them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Unfortunately, the people of Israel frequently forsook God and broke their covenant with him. Even so, his love for them never completely dissipated (see <a href="?bref=Hos.3.1">Hos 3:1</a>). Their apostasy resulted in God’s judgment—culminating in exile from their land—but even in the midst of this catastrophe, he preserved a remnant of his people and pledged to restore them (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.8-9">Isa 65:8-9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Old Testament prophets anticipated a future time when God would display his love for Israel by sending a Branch of David (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">Isa 11:1-5</a>), a righteous King (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.9-10">Zech 9:9-10</a>), a Sun of Righteousness (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.1-3">Mal 4:1-3</a>). The fulfillment of these prophecies came through Christ, whose death produced another central event for God’s people, also commemorated with a meal—the Lord’s Supper (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.20-34">1 Cor 11:20-34</a>). This redemptive act of God provided the ultimate demonstration of love for his people—both Jews and Gentiles.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Preaching to a Tough Crowd</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Sometimes God calls individuals to proclaim his word to a difficult audience. The listeners may be resistant to God’s truth and may reject both the message and the messenger. This was especially true of the Old Testament prophets, who often proclaimed messages the people did not want to hear (see <a href="?bref=Jer.26.7-9">Jer 26:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.38.1-6">38:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-13">Amos 7:10-13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Malachi’s sermons were directed to a tough audience. Among those in his congregation were the disillusioned (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.2">Mal 1:2</a>), the cynical (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.7">1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.2.2">2:2</a>), the callous (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.13-16">2:13-16</a>), the dishonest (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">3:5</a>), the apathetic (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.14-15">3:14-15</a>), the doubters and skeptics, and the truly wicked (see <a href="?bref=Mal.4.1">4:1</a>). What does a preacher say to this kind of crowd?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Malachi engaged his audience rhetorically through dialogue in a series of disputations. The prophet’s strong rebuke and clever anticipation of his audience’s rebuttals was a wake-up call that hit the mark: “Those who feared the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke with each other, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> listened to what they said” (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.16">3:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Like the prophets, both Jesus and his followers found themselves proclaiming messages to resistant audiences (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-30">Luke 4:16-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.22-40">John 10:22-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.26-40">Acts 5:26-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.30-23.10">22:30–23:10</a>). But such resistance did not provide impetus for neglecting the God-ordained task of proclaiming his word (see <a href="?bref=Acts.5.41-42">Acts 5:41-42</a>). While those who preach a message from the Lord can hope for a positive response, as in the case of Malachi, such receptivity is by no means guaranteed.</p>

<title>Genealogy of Jesus</title>
<refs>Matt.1.1-17</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Genealogy of Jesus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Both Matthew and Luke provide genealogies of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-17">Matt 1:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.23-38">Luke 3:23-38</a>). The two genealogies differ for the generations following King David. Matthew follows the line of David’s son Solomon, while Luke follows the line of David’s son Nathan. One possible explanation is that Matthew records Joseph’s genealogy while Luke records Mary’s (in which case Joseph would have been Heli’s son-in-law).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Genealogies were kept quite accurately in Judaism, as Josephus confirms (Josephus, <span class="ital">Life</span> 1). Genealogies were important in the Old Testament and in Judaism generally because land rights were apportioned to families in Israel and because certain offices, such as priest and king, were inherited from father to son. Genealogies sometimes ran a record from the past to the present to illustrate religious themes, family descent, or political ties, as well as simple chronology (<a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-9.44">1 Chr 1–9</a>). Most such lists were representative rather than a complete list of every individual.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The purpose of Matthew’s genealogy, unlike Luke’s, is to show Jesus’ heritage as running from Abraham through David. Jesus’ genealogy confirms him as a legitimate heir to the throne of David. So Jesus’ genealogy in Matthew goes back to Abraham, the father of the Jewish race. By contrast, the genealogy in Luke goes all the way back to Adam. This is consistent with Luke’s emphasis on Jesus as the Savior for all people everywhere.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Matthew’s genealogy, the unusual mention of women with stained reputations (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba), some of them Gentiles, is noteworthy and emphasizes God’s grace to redeem even those deemed unworthy by others.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus’ genealogies do not prove that Jesus is the Messiah, but they do make him a possible candidate. His identity as the Messiah becomes evident in other ways (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-6">Matt 11:2-6</a>). God had guided the course of history to its climax. Jesus is the anticipated Messiah of the Old Testament, the Savior of his people, and the King descended from David assuming his throne (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sam 7:16</a>). He is heir to Abraham and ultimately fulfills God’s promises to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gen 12:1-3</a>).</p>

<title>The Blessings of Jesus</title>
<refs>Matt.5.3-12</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Blessings of Jesus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The blessings of Jesus are called Beatitudes because the Vulgate (the Latin translation of the Bible) translates the Greek word for <span class="ital">blessed</span> as <span class="latin">beati</span>. No single word can capture all that Jesus is communicating with this term here. He is describing the special favor of God toward his people, both physically and spiritually, and the consequences of living within that favor.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Beatitudes describe the lifestyle and character of a follower of Jesus. Jesus calls men and women to follow him as he proclaims the message of the Kingdom to Israel (see also <a href="?bref=Matt.11.6">Matt 11:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.16">13:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">16:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.46">24:46</a>). Those who are blessed have repented in response to the proclamation of the Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17-22">Matt 4:17-22</a>). The Beatitudes are connected with <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-3">Isa 61:1-3</a>: The Spirit endows, leads to proclamation, and blesses the poor, the humble, and the righteous.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The NLT’s use of “God blesses” conveys the ideas of divine origin and approval (see <a href="?bref=Matt.25.34">Matt 25:34</a>), fulfillment (see <a href="?bref=Matt.11.6">Matt 11:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.16">13:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">16:17</a>), reversal (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-2.52">Luke 1:1–2:52</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.20-26">6:20-26</a>), and the condition of obedience required in order to enjoy the blessings (see <a href="?bref=Ps.1.1">Pss 1:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.1.3-6">3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.3">106:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1-2">112:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.1-2">119:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.8.32">Prov 8:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.56.2">Isa 56:2</a>).

<title>Little Faith</title>
<refs>Matt.6.30</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Little Faith</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The term translated “little faith” and related Greek terms are used five times in Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.30">6:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.8.26">8:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.14.31">14:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.8">16:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.20">17:20</a>) and only once elsewhere (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.28">Luke 12:28</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Jas.1.6-7">Jas 1:6-7</a>). The term refers to a specific event rather than to ongoing and permanent failure. In Matthew, “little faith” happens either due to lack of knowledge on the part of Jesus’ disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.8-11">Matt 16:8-11</a>) or due to acting without faith during a particular incident. If someone always lacks faith, it is described as “unbelief” (see <a href="?bref=Matt.13.58">Matt 13:58</a>). As examples of “little faith,” the disciples do not understand their value or God’s providential protection <a href="?bref=Matt.6.30">Matt 6:30</a>; they do not understand God’s protection in the midst of physical danger <a href="?bref=Matt.8.26">8:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.14.31">14:31</a>; they do not understand Jesus’ saying regarding yeast <a href="?bref=Matt.16.8">16:8</a>; and they are not able to exorcise a demon <a href="?bref=Matt.17.20">17:20</a>. These are instances of failure in specific circumstances, not a case of having no faith whatsoever.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The term <span class="ital">faith</span> reflects at least two ideas: <span class="ital">trust</span> (personal reliance upon the Lord) and <span class="ital">belief</span> (affirmation of truths). Matthew’s concern with “little faith” is about lack of trust by a follower of Jesus who is in a specific situation, rather than a failure to have basic belief in Jesus as Lord and Savior. Jesus wants his followers not only to believe in him, but also to trust, love, and obey him (see <a href="?bref=Matt.7.21-29">Matt 7:21-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.34-40">22:34-40</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Citizenship in the Kingdom</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">First-century Jews were looking for a king like David or Judas Maccabeus who would overthrow their oppressors. Jesus’ vision of the Kingdom of God was radically different from these expectations (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-48">5:43-48</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Matthew presents Jesus as a teacher unlike any other, and the Sermon on the Mount is his longest and most famous sermon. More than simply a collection of Jesus’ ethical or moral teachings, it is a manifesto of citizenship in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus framed the Kingdom of Heaven primarily in terms of (1) an upward relationship with God, (2) an inward change of heart, and (3) outward relationships with other people. This new message of the Kingdom was compelling to Jesus’ hearers (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.28-29">7:28-29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The tendency is to make hard distinctions between these three areas, but all three are always present. For example, Jesus’ instruction to humility (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.5">5:5</a>) at first seems simply inward, but it is also about attitude toward God and others. The command not to resist an evil person (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.39">5:39</a>) seems outward-focused, but often requires active faith in God and internal fortitude. Jesus’ instruction on prayer (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.5-15">6:5-15</a>) is primarily about our relationship with God, but prayer requires an internal recognition of need and is often about relationships with others.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Citizenship in the Kingdom of Heaven has a central requirement: Those who wish to follow Jesus and enter the Kingdom of Heaven must stop living self-centered lives and instead live God-centered ones. Those who try to achieve righteousness on their own still have self at the center and are still living in darkness. The call of Jesus is to live a life of true righteousness – the righteousness of God himself (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">5:20</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.48">48</a>). This is not a righteousness that can be attained. Instead, Jesus gives it to those who follow him.</p>

<title>The Son of Man</title>
<refs>Matt.8.20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Son of Man</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">“Son of Man” was Jesus’ favorite way to refer to himself. The phrase is just as odd in Greek as in English: It translates the Hebrew phrase <span class="hebrew">ben ’adam,</span> an idiom that means “human being” or “person” (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.2.1-8">Ezek 2:1-8</a>). One reason Jesus preferred this name was because it was not an inflammatory title such as “Christ” or “Messiah.” The expression is used in three ways in the Gospels:</p>
<p class="theme-body">(1) The background to Jesus’ use of the title is <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">Dan 7:13-14</a>, where an exalted messianic figure “like a son of man” (that is, having human form) comes with the clouds of heaven and is given great glory and power. Jesus understood himself as the one who would return to earth in the clouds of heaven (see <a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">13:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">14:62</a>). Sometimes Jesus used “Son of Man” in this sense, to refer to his role as judge, deliverer, savior, and vindicator (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.23">Matt 10:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.41">13:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.27">24:27</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">30</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.24.37">37</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.24.44">44</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31">25:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.64">26:64</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">(2) Often Jesus used “Son of Man” to describe himself as a suffering redeemer (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.9">17:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.17.12">12</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.17.22">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.18">20:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.2">26:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.26.24">24</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.26.45">45</a>). This sense is rooted in <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">Isa 52:13–53:12</a>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">(3) At times, Jesus apparently used “Son of Man” to refer to himself as the representative of humans (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.20">Matt 8:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.19">11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.8">12:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.12.32">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.37">13:37</a>). The book of Ezekiel uses “son of man” in a similar sense (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.2.1-8">Ezek 2:1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus did not use “Son of Man” to distinguish his humanity from his deity (“Son of God”). By using this title, Jesus could define himself as Messiah on his own terms. He used “Son of Man” to describe his total identity and as a veiled suggestion that those who watched and heard him should pay attention to who he is.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Eating Together</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Eating meals together was a religious matter among the Pharisees and other observant Jews. Righteous Jews enacted many regulations to prevent themselves from being ceremonially defiled at meals. It was not done so much to exclude others as to show commitment to the law.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Most Jews lived by the food laws most of the time. Jesus did so, too. But he regularly, purposefully, and offensively ate with those who were ritually unclean or whose commitment to the law was inferior. Sharing a meal with another indicated both covenantal and social equality (cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.26-29">Matt 26:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27-30">2 Kgs 25:27-30</a>). The Pharisees, believing that separation from such sinners was a necessity for righteousness, were offended by Jesus’ sharing meals with such people (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.10-11">Matt 9:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.19">11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.28-32">21:28-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">Luke 7:36-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.1-2">15:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.1-10">19:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus’ sharing meals with sinful people enacted God’s grace—he extended God’s love and forgiveness, welcoming open participation in a new society. This practice developed into the early Christian communion meals (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.17-34">1 Cor 11:17-34</a>). And as is clear from the Last Supper, the meals Jesus shared with his followers anticipated the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.29">Matt 26:29</a>; see <a href="?bref=Matt.8.11-12">8:11-12</a>). The apostle Paul extended Jesus’ practice to enable fellowship between Jews and Gentiles in the church (see <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-21">Gal 2:11-21</a>). Jesus tore down the barriers separating us from one another and from God (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-18">Eph 2:14-18</a>) and calls us into fellowship with all his people.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Compassionate Healer</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus is frequently described as one who “had compassion.” This expression (sometimes translated “felt sorry” or “took pity”) is used of Jesus in complex situations where (1) distress is expressed (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-26">Matt 18:23-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.29-33">20:29-33</a>) and Jesus remedies the distress (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.27">Matt 18:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.34">20:34</a>), (2) Jesus shows deep emotion (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.14">Matt 14:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.32">15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.27">18:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.34">20:34</a>), or (3) there is a contrast with those who are not compassionate (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.32-36">Matt 9:32-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.27-30">18:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.29-34">20:29-34</a>). In the Gospels, the phrase “had compassion” refers only to Jesus directly, but is also used in parables where it can refer to God the Father or to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.27">Matt 18:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.33">Luke 10:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.20">15:20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, the term compassion is used for God’s covenant love for Israel. God withdrew this compassion to judge Israel’s obstinate unfaithfulness (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.11">Isa 27:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.15">63:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.14">Jer 13:14</a>). God restored his compassion when Israel repented (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.18">Deut 13:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.2-3">30:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.28.13">Prov 28:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.7">Isa 55:7</a>). The Old Testament often describes the messianic age as a time of God’s compassion (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.1">Isa 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.10">49:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.49.13">13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.8">54:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.54.10">10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.10">60:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.15">Jer 12:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.26">33:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.25">Ezek 39:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.19">Mic 7:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.3.2">Hab 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.6">Zech 10:6</a>). The resurgence of this notion in the Gospels reflects this, as the messianic age has dawned and God’s covenant love is once again active in Israel.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Jesus and Satan</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus was opposed by a personal agent of sin and evil (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1-11">Matt 4:1-11</a>). In Matthew, he is called “Satan” (meaning <span class="ital">Adversary;</span> <a href="?bref=Matt.4.10">4:10</a>), the “devil” (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1-11">4:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.39">13:39</a>), the “tempter” (see footnote on <a href="?bref=Matt.4.3">4:3</a>), the “prince of demons” (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.34">9:34</a>), “Beelzeboul” (see footnote on <a href="?bref=Matt.12.24">12:24</a>), the “evil one” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.13">6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.19">13:19</a>), and “the enemy” (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.39">13:39</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus’ mission of announcing and bringing in the Kingdom of God inevitably led to conflict with Satan’s forces, including exorcisms (see <a href="?bref=Matt.8.16-17">Matt 8:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.32-34">9:32-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.1">10:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.10.7-8">7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.22-29">12:22-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.1-20">Mark 5:1-20</a>). Matthew records that Satan has power over kingdoms (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.8-9">4:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.26">12:26</a>) and that he has angels at his command (see footnote on <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">25:41</a>). Satan’s primary tool is temptation, and his goal is to generate disobedience to God (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1-11">Matt 4:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.13">6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.23">16:23</a>).

But Christ has defeated him and will eventually strip Satan of all his powers (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Matt 25:41</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.31">John 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-10">Rev 20:1-10</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Messiah</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Greek term <span class="greek">christos</span> is equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">mashiakh</span> (“anointed one”), and both terms can be translated as “Messiah.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">In Judaism, the term <span class="ital">messiah</span> was understood in a variety of ways. The Old Testament refers to people, not all of them honorable, who were specially anointed by God for a variety of reasons or tasks (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.41">Exod 28:41</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.16">1 Sam 9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16">1 Kgs 19:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.1">Isa 45:1</a>).The prophets expected a future Messiah who would usher in God’s Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.25-26">Dan 9:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9-10">Zech 9:9-10</a>). The dominant expectation among Jews in Jesus’ time was that the Messiah would be a political warrior who would lead Israel to victory over its oppressors and reestablish Israel as a separate kingdom (see <span class="ital">Psalms of Solomon</span> 17–18). Some Jews saw the Messiah as a forerunner of the Kingdom of God. The community at Qumran, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, expected a Messiah who would function both as a priest and as a political warrior.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Given such ambiguity, it is not surprising that Jesus avoided the title. He taught his followers that he would suffer according to Isaiah’s predictions (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">Isa 52:13–53:12</a>, which Jews interpreted as referring to the nation of Israel). The emphasis Jesus gave to suffering and service as the path of victory (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21-28">Matt 16:21-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.25-28">20:25-28</a>) collided with the popular Jewish paradigm of the Messiah as a royal conqueror. It was, however, God’s means of bringing about his Kingdom (see <a href="?bref=Luke.2.25-32">Luke 2:25-32</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.37-50">John 12:37-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.29-36">Acts 2:29-36</a>).</p>

Though he was born in David’s line, his mother’s reputation was tainted (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-25">Matt 1:18-25</a>).

His ministry was in Galilee, a backwater distant from official Judaism (see <a href="?bref=Matt.4.12-16">Matt 4:12-16</a>).

His revelations were reserved for the unlikely (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.25-27">11:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.16-17">13:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-20">16:13-20</a>), and he often spoke of his own humiliating death (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21">16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.22-23">17:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.18-19">20:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.2">26:2</a>). Jesus did not come with the flash and spark of someone in need of attention, nor did he make his status and calling glowingly obvious. Instead, he chose the path of humility, privacy, and revelation recognized by faith.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the end, Jesus was vindicated: He won arguments (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.20-40">Luke 20:20-40</a>), exorcized demons (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.28-34">Matt 8:28-34</a>), healed wondrously (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.1-8">Matt 9:1-8</a>), raised people from the dead (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.18-26">Matt 9:18-26</a>), and ultimately rose from the dead himself (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-10">Matt 28:1-10</a>). His divisive but effective ministry inaugurated God’s Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-6">Matt 11:2-6</a>).</p>

<title>Faith and Good Deeds</title>
<refs>Matt.25.31-46</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Faith and Good Deeds</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus did not teach salvation by works—he taught the necessity of a conversion (an internal reorientation toward God by an act of God’s grace), which results in a life of obedience. Good works are the natural consequence of a relationship with Jesus Christ (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.7.15-20">Matt 7:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.33-37">12:33-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.15-20">15:15-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The parable of the sheep and the goats is an example of the indissoluble link between faith and works. The connection between faith, works, and final approval is a consistent feature of Jesus’ teachings (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.7.13-27">Matt 7:13-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.3-9">13:3-9</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.13.18-23">18-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">16:27</a>). For Jesus, works are a sure indicator of faith, which begins with repentance—a conversion of the heart and mind that involves turning away from sin to God (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17">Matt 4:17</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">3:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.3.8-10">8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.20-24">11:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.38-42">12:38-42</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">A misapplication of the concept of salvation by grace alone has led to a false dichotomy between faith and works. Salvation is not achieved by works, but neither is it without works (see <a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Gal.5.21">21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.10">Eph 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5-10">1 Jn 1:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">Rev 21:8</a>). Jesus promises blessing and reward to those who live in accord with God’s will (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">Matt 5:3-12</a>). Consequently, righteousness is required of those who want to enter the Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.20-48">5:20-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.7.21">7:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.11-14">22:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.3">23:3</a>). Faith that does not result in works is not saving faith (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">Jas 2:14-26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">James, in his conspicuous emphasis on faithfulness to God, argues for charitable deeds as an expression of faith (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">2:14-26</a>). A faith relationship with God cannot be based merely on believing a true statement (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.19">2:19</a>). Saving faith results in actions (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.22-25">1:22-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.14">2:14</a>). Faithful actions emulate God, who generously gives good gifts (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.5">1:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Jas.1.17">17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.6">4:6</a>). Faith and good deeds are therefore inseparable. As with Abraham, good deeds show that a person has complete faith and is righteous before God (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.23">2:23</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gen 15:6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus taught and modeled faith that does good deeds (see <a href="?bref=Matt.5.13-16">Matt 5:13-16</a>), and Paul also affirmed the need for good deeds (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.6">Rom 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.5-10">Gal 6:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.10">Eph 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.12-13">Phil 2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.3">1 Thes 1:3</a>). James points to some specific actions which demonstrate faith, including caring for orphans and widows (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.27">1:27</a>), avoiding favoritism toward the rich (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.1-7">2:1-7</a>), providing food and clothing for the poor (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.15-17">2:15-17</a>), controlling one’s tongue (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.1-12">3:1-12</a>), promoting peace (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.17-18">3:17-18</a>), and refraining from judging others (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.11-12">4:11-12</a>). All of these things can be understood as “faith expressing itself in love” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>).</p>

<title>The Resurrection of Jesus</title>
<refs>Matt.28.1-15</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Resurrection of Jesus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Scripture unanimously depicts the personal and bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead by the power of God, but numerous other attempts to explain it have emerged: (1) Jesus never really died—instead, he lost consciousness and regained it after being laid in a cool tomb (the swoon theory); (2) the disciples of Jesus stole his body and then lied about a resurrection (see <a href="?bref=Matt.28.12-15">Matt 28:12-15</a>); (3) the disciples had hallucinations and dreams that they mistakenly confused with a physical resurrection; and (4) the resurrection is a personal experience in the heart of faith, not an event in history. Behind such suggestions lies a deep-seated skepticism toward the supernatural, or at least toward whether a miraculous event could have happened. Such suggestions fail to take into account the fact that for New Testament authors and their audiences, the term <span class="ital">resurrection</span> could only have meant the literal reanimation of a dead corpse (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">1 Cor 15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The historicity of Jesus’ resurrection and the historical reliability of the biblical accounts are supported by (1) the evidence of an empty tomb; (2) the presence of women as witnesses (no one would have made up a story with women as witnesses, since the testimony of a woman was considered to be less reliable than that of a man); (3) the varied but basically unified accounts of Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances; (4) the transformation of the disciples from a fearful band into fearless followers; and (5) the disciples’ ability to overcome the scandal of following a crucified man (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.23">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> indicates that one who dies such a death has fallen under God’s curse). Judaism had no concept of a dying and rising Messiah that could conveniently be applied to Jesus. Inventing something no one would find conceivable would have made little sense. The most reasonable conclusion is just what the New Testament announces: that Jesus did, in fact, rise from the dead.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Coming of God’s Kingdom</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">A central component of Jesus’ message was that God’s Kingdom had arrived. The arrival of God’s Kingdom was eagerly awaited by the people of Israel, for it would fulfill the many promises of God that had not yet been realized:</p>
<p class="theme-list-sp">The Spirit would not only come again, as he had in the past, but he would come upon each individual believer in fulfillment of <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Joel 2:28-32</a> (cp. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.16-21">Acts 2:16-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">Satan would be defeated (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.27">Mark 3:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.17-18">Luke 10:17-18</a>), as was already being demonstrated by Jesus’ exorcisms (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.21-28">Mark 1:21-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.1-20">5:1-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.20">Luke 11:20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">The new covenant promised in <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a> would be established (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mark 14:24</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">The resurrection from the dead would produce its firstfruits (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mark 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.9">9:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.9.31">31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.33-34">10:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.6">16:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20">1 Cor 15:20</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">God’s Anointed, the promised Son of David (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-12">Matt 2:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.25-38">Luke 2:25-38</a>) would arrive.</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp">These dimensions of God’s Kingdom have already been fulfilled in the birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. People are to repent and believe the gospel because God’s Kingdom has arrived in the person of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Matt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.10">6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-15">Mark 1:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.26-32">4:26-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.42-43">Luke 4:42-43</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">With the coming of the Kingdom through Jesus, things radically changed in Israel. The Spirit was once again active in the land, working through the prophet John the Baptist and in the ministry of Jesus. For those with eyes to see, the promised Messiah, or Christ, had appeared. Because God’s Kingdom was with them in the person of Jesus, the disciples could not fast like the Pharisees and the disciples of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.18-20">Mark 2:18-20</a>). Fasting became inappropriate, for the Old Testament promises were being fulfilled. It was time to celebrate and feast (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.19-20">Mark 2:19-20</a>), because God’s reign had begun. People were already entering into the Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-31">Mark 10:23-31</a>) and experiencing its manifestations (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.1">Mark 9:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">There is a future, not-yet-realized dimension of God’s Kingdom that awaits Christ’s return (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.25">Mark 14:25</a>). The ultimate judgment of evil, the final establishment of justice, and the eradication of disease, poverty, and even death will find their fulfillment when Jesus, the Son of Man, returns in glory, gathers his elect (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.24-27">Mark 13:24-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.11-14">Titus 2:11-14</a>), judges the world (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">14:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Matt 25:31-46</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1">2 Tim 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.14-20">Rev 14:14-20</a>), and resurrects the dead (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-57">1 Cor 15:12-57</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-5.11">1 Thes 4:13–5:11</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Secret of the Messiah</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout the Gospel of Mark, Jesus tells others—those he healed or raised from the dead, the disciples who recognized him as the Christ, and the demons who had a correct understanding of his true identity—not to reveal his identity (e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.1.34">Mark 1:34</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.1.44">44</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.11-12">3:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.43">5:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.36">7:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.29-30">8:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.9">9:9</a>; this theme occurs far less frequently in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke—see <a href="?bref=Matt.8.4">Matt 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.20">16:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.21">Luke 9:21</a>). Why did Jesus command those he healed and those who knew his true identity to keep his healings and identity secret?</p>
<p class="theme-body">One possibility relates to how the Roman authorities would have responded to an extremely popular preacher who proclaimed the arrival of God’s Kingdom, performed marvelous healings, and openly allowed his followers to call him Israel’s long-awaited Messiah and King. Roman authorities would not tolerate it—they would immediately seek to suppress such a movement. In the Roman Empire, there was no room for another kingdom or for a messianic rescuer from Roman occupation. Thus, though Jesus acknowledged to his disciples that he was the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-30">Mark 8:27-30</a>), he did not intend to overthrow Rome.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Another possible reason for this secrecy has to do with the prolific misunderstanding of Jesus’ identity that we see throughout the Gospel of Mark, even among his closest followers. Jesus makes clear that his identity as Messiah and Son of God is directly tied to his suffering and death, a reality which did not match up with Jewish expectations regarding the Messiah. Thus, immediately after Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah, Jesus announces that he would suffer and die (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-31">Mark 8:27-31</a>), which generates a response from Peter that demonstrates his lack of understanding (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.32-33">8:32-33</a>). It was not his miracles or his profound teaching that served as the primary attribute of his messiahship, but rather his sacrificial death.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For these reasons, it was expedient for Jesus to teach about God’s Kingdom in parables (see <a href="?bref=Mark.4.1-34">Mark 4:1-34</a>, especially <a href="?bref=Mark.4.10-12">4:10-12</a>), to minimize the excitement created by his miracles (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.44">1:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.43">5:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.36">7:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.26">8:26</a>), to conceal his presence at times from the people (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.24">7:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.30-31">9:30-31</a>), to conceal his teaching from outsiders (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.10-12">4:10-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.4.33-34">33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.17">7:17</a>), and to command those who knew his true identity not to reveal it (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.23-26">1:23-26</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.1.34">34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.11-12">3:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.29-30">8:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.9">9:9</a>). Jesus came “to give his life as a ransom for many” (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">10:45</a>), not to lead the nation of Israel in rebellion against Rome.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Nonetheless, Jesus Christ, the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mark 1:1</a>), could not be hidden. The secret was not and cannot be kept (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.36">7:36</a>), for Jesus is too great. Those who experienced and witnessed his healing touch could not help but proclaim what he had done. Jesus’ identity broke through, and it became clear that he is indeed the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord over nature, disease, and death. And for the readers of the Gospel of Mark, who are made aware of his identity in the very first verse, Jesus was demonstrated to be the Messiah precisely because of—not in spite of—his suffering, death, and resurrection.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Son of God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Time and again Jesus’ healings, exorcisms, raising of the dead, and teachings created wonder, awe, amazement, and fear (e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.1.22">Mark 1:22</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.1.27">27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.41">4:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.15">5:15</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.5.20">20</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.5.33">33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.37">7:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.24">10:24</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.10.26">26</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.10.32">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.17">12:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.5">15:5</a>). This amazement emphasizes the miraculous nature of Jesus’ ministry. The Gospel writers wanted their readers to ask themselves, “Who is this man? . . . Even the wind and waves obey him!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.27">Matt 8:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.41">Mark 4:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.25">Luke 8:25</a>). Mark gives the answer at the very beginning of his Gospel: Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mark 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, the title “Son of God” is applied to the people of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.22">Exod 4:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.5-6">Deut 32:5-6</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.32.18-19">18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.82.6">Ps 82:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.3.19">Jer 3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.9">31:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.31.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1">Hos 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.2.10">Mal 2:10</a>) and to angels (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.2">Gen 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.1.6">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.1">2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.38.7">38:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.1">Ps 29:1</a>). It is also applied in a special way to Israel’s king—the anointed king was seen as God’s “son” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.14">2 Sam 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.22.10">1 Chr 22:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.6">28:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Pss 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.26-27">89:26-27</a>). The title also appears in intertestamental Jewish literature (including the Apocrypha and the Dead Sea Scrolls), possibly in reference to the coming Messiah. Jews in the first century would have likely considered the coming Messiah as a “Son of God.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus’ identity as “the Son of God” was affirmed by God at his baptism (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mark 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">Matt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.22">Luke 3:22</a>) and by demons he encountered during his ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.29">Matt 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.24">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.34">1:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.11">3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.7">5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.34">Luke 4:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.28">8:28</a>). Later, the disciples recognized Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Matt 16:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.29">Mark 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.20">Luke 9:20</a>) and Jesus immediately began to teach them of his forthcoming death (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Matt 16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mark 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.20">Luke 9:22</a>). Then, at Jesus’ transfiguration, God affirmed the disciples’ confession (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.5">Matt 17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">Mark 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.35">Luke 9:35</a>). As Jesus approached his death, he affirmed his unique identity as God’s Son, both through his teaching (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.1-12">Mark 12:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.32">13:32</a>) and at his trial (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.61-62">Mark 14:61-62</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Gospels, the climactic confession of Jesus’ identity as God’s Son took place at the crucifixion, where a Roman centurion became the first human in the narrative to recognize that Jesus is truly the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">Mark 15:39</a>). While Jesus’ identity as the Son of God is demonstrated in his exorcisms and by his Father’s declarations, his sacrificial death and the way he died (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.33-39">Mark 15:33-39</a>) provide the supreme evidence that he is the Son of God.</p>

<title>Following Jesus</title>
<refs>Mark.8.34-38</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Following Jesus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">One of the core purposes of the Gospels is to help readers understand and accept the call to take up their cross and follow Jesus. This call is addressed not only to those who would be Jesus’ apostles (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.13-19">Mark 3:13-19</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">1:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">2:14</a>) but to all who desired to follow him (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.34">Mark 8:34</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Mark.2.15">2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.21">10:21</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.10.52">52</a>). For some, the call to discipleship is very hard (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.17-25">Mark 10:17-25</a>), but God provides grace (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.27">10:27</a>). Others find it easy to respond to Jesus’ call (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mark 2:14</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">Luke 7:36-50</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">For everyone, following Jesus requires a total commitment to turn from selfish ways (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.34-35">Mark 8:34-35</a>). Taking up one’s cross is a metaphor for giving up one’s life to follow Jesus—even to death. For example, Peter, Andrew, James, and John left their homes and their source of income to follow Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">Mark 1:16-20</a>). For one rich man, turning from his selfish ways required selling all he had and giving the proceeds to the poor (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.21">Mark 10:21</a>). Following Jesus also means being identified with him without being ashamed and being faithful to him and his teachings (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mark 8:38</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rom.10.9">Rom 10:9</a>). It requires removing anything that would interfere with following Jesus, regardless of how painful doing so might be (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.43-48">Mark 9:43-48</a>). It requires entrusting one’s life entirely to Jesus and repenting of sin (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mark 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.12">6:12</a>). It even requires putting loyalty to Jesus above loyalty to one’s own father and mother (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.37">Matt 10:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.26">Luke 14:26</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus explicitly commanded his disciples to proclaim his message (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.18-20">Matt 28:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.47-49">Luke 24:47-49</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>). And we see throughout the rest of the New Testament that Jesus’ followers did indeed proclaim the Good News wherever they went, leading to more and more followers (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.14-41">Acts 2:14-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.12-26">3:12-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-2">4:1-2</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.4.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.4">8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.20">9:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-26">11:19-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-16">Rom 1:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.14-15">10:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.18-21">15:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.16">1 Cor 9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.23">Col 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">1 Thes 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.2">2 Tim 4:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Alongside Jesus’ demands for discipleship are the rewards of following Jesus. Those who follow Jesus are promised entrance into the Kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.43-48">Mark 9:43-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-31">10:23-31</a>). They receive his forgiveness for their sins (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.10-11">Mark 2:10-11</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Mark.3.28">3:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.25">11:25</a>), and they become members of the family of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">John 1:12</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Encounters with Jesus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus’ dramatic miracles and intriguing parables can overshadow his transformative encounters with individuals. In these encounters Jesus deals with people where they are and as they are. He invites people of all backgrounds, personalities, and commitments to embrace him as master and friend, to become his followers and ambassadors of his eternal Kingdom. But Jesus’ invitation to follow always comes with a choice, because the power and wealth of this world is often too heavy and distracting to carry into Kingdom service. To follow Jesus, those who encounter him usually have to abandon something and leave it behind. Those who cannot give up what this world offers are often forced to turn away from Jesus. The same choice faces all who encounter Jesus in the Gospels and hear his invitation to follow.</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Andrew</span> was a fisherman in Galilee, but he longed for the Messiah and his Kingdom. He followed John the Baptist until John pointed to Jesus. Then Andrew not only followed Jesus, but called others, including Peter, to come too. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.1.29-42">John 1:29-42</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Simeon and Anna</span> had long waited to see the promised Messiah. When they saw the infant Jesus, they recognized him as the Messiah, blessed him, and praised God for his coming and the hope he brought. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Luke.2.25-38">Luke 2:25-38</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Nathanael</span> responded skeptically when he was first invited to meet Jesus, but when Jesus demonstrated that he already knew him, Nathanael’s response dramatically changed, and he followed Jesus without hesitation. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.1.43-51">John 1:43-51</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">A rich man</span> came to Jesus and asked what he should do to inherit eternal life. This man demonstrated humility and was careful to obey all God’s laws. Jesus loved this man but told him that he still needed to sell all his possessions, give to the poor, and follow him. The man was unwilling to abandon his wealth and in sadness walked away from Jesus. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Mark.10.17-22">Mark 10:17-22</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Matthew</span> had turned from his Jewish heritage, become a traitor to his people by collecting Roman taxes, and chosen a lifestyle of wealthy indulgence. When Jesus called him, Matthew left his old life and followed. Before joining Jesus in his travels, Matthew invited his friends to meet Jesus. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-13">Matthew 9:9-13</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Thomas</span> doubted the other disciples’ claim that Jesus had come back to life. When Jesus finally appeared to Thomas, he singled Thomas out and asked him to touch his wounded, resurrected body. Thomas immediately bowed before Jesus and confessed what he believed—that Jesus was his Lord and God. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.20.19-29">John 20:19-29</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Martha</span> was working hard to prepare a meal for Jesus in her home and became upset that her sister Mary was sitting and learning at Jesus’ feet. Jesus gently encouraged Martha not to be angry and pointed out that Mary had chosen best by stopping to listen. On a later occasion, Jesus confronted Martha to affirm faith in him for eternal life. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">Luke 10:38-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.17-27">John 11:17-27</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">A Roman officer</span> asked Jesus to save his dying slave but excused Jesus from coming to his unclean Gentile home, because he believed Jesus could heal his slave from where he stood. Jesus honored this Roman’s faith by doing just that. Jesus also affirmed that many Gentiles would be welcomed by faith into the Kingdom of Heaven. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Matt.8.5-13">Matthew 8:5-13</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">A woman caught in adultery</span> was brought by Jewish leaders to Jesus for judgment. Stoning was the expected punishment, but Jesus, writing in the dust, asked any accuser without sin to throw the first stone. When they all walked away, Jesus told the woman to go and sin no more. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.8.1-11">John 8:1-11</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Nicodemus</span>, a leading Pharisee, was cautious about being seen with Jesus, so he came to him at night. Jesus engaged Nicodemus and challenged his assumptions about spiritual truth. Nicodemus later defended Jesus in the Council. After the crucifixion, he helped to bury Jesus, revealing his commitment. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.3.1-21">John 3:1-21</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.50-52">7:50-52</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.38-42">19:38-42</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">James and John</span> believed God’s Kingdom was at hand, and they requested places of honor, angering the other disciples. Jesus gently explained that true leadership is demonstrated through service, not wealth or power. The disciples would all learn this through hard experience.  <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-45">Mark 10:35-45</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.1-17">John 13:1-17</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">The people of Nazareth</span> had known Jesus as Joseph’s son and couldn’t believe he could be the Messiah. Their doubt greatly limited Jesus’ miracles among them, and their anger at his claims forced him to leave. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Luke.4.14-30">Luke 4:14-30</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">The religious leaders</span> knew and obeyed external laws down to fine detail but failed to show love in more important ways. Over and over again, Jesus confronted them for this, but most of these leaders rejected Jesus’ criticism and looked for ways to destroy him. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Luke.11.37-54">Luke 11:37-54</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Acts.6.8-8.1">Acts 6:8–8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-31">9:1-31</a></span> </p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Zacchaeus</span> collected taxes for Rome, becoming wealthy at his people’s expense. He was curious about Jesus and climbed a tree to see him over the crowd. Jesus singled him out, went to his house, and called Zacchaeus to a new life. Zacchaeus repented of his ways and paid back everyone he had wronged. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Luke.19.1-10">Luke 19:1-10</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Two followers of Jesus</span> were returning home to Emmaus after Jesus’ death. Along the way, the resurrected Jesus joined them and explained from Scripture why he had died. They didn’t recognize Jesus until he broke bread with them, after which Jesus disappeared. The two joyfully went to tell the disciples that Jesus was alive. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=Luke.24.13-35">Luke 24:13-35</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">A Samaritan woman</span> of ill-repute went to Jacob’s well to draw water and found Jesus there. Jesus offered her living water and a new life. She was surprised but responded in faith and called others to meet the Messiah they longed for. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.4.1-42">John 4:1-42</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Pilate</span> was pressured by the Jewish leaders to execute Jesus. He believed Jesus was innocent and sought to free him. Pilate asked Jesus, “What is truth?” but did not realize that Jesus himself was the Truth. In the end, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified to keep the peace. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.18.28-19.16">John 18:28–19:16</a></span></p>
<p class="theme-body-fl-sp"><span class="bold">Simon Peter</span> denied three times that he even knew Jesus. After his resurrection, Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. Each time, Peter reaffirmed his love, and Jesus told him to feed his sheep. Thus, Jesus restored Peter. <span class="ital">See <a href="?bref=John.21.1-23">John 21:1-23</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.16.15-19">Matt 16:15-19</a></span></p>

<title>The Day Is Coming</title>
<refs>Mark.13.1-37</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Day Is Coming</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus predicted three future events in the synoptic Gospels. One was his own death and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mark 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.31">9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.33-34">10:33-34</a>); this was a past event when the Gospels were written.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The second event that Jesus predicted was the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-28">Matt 24:1-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-23">13:1-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.41-44">Luke 19:41-44</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.5-24">21:5-24</a>). This event was probably about to happen when Mark wrote his Gospel (see <a href="?item=Mark_BookIntro_Filament">Mark Book Introduction</a>, “Date”). It would not signify the very end, so the Christian community must continue to live in faithful watchfulness after this event for the Son of God’s return in glory, which might be soon (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.34-37">Mark 13:34-37</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The third event that Jesus predicted was his own future return (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.39">Matt 23:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.3">24:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.24.29-31">29-31</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.24.36-25.46">24:36–25:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.24-27">13:24-27</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.13.32-37">32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.25-36">Luke 21:25-36</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.1-3">John 14:1-3</a>). References to Jesus’ return can be found throughout the New Testament (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.7-8">1 Cor 1:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.13">3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.14">2 Cor 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.6">Phil 1:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Phil.1.10">10</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.16">2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-11">1 Thes 5:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.2">2 Thes 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.12">2 Tim 1:12</a>, <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1">4:1</a>, <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.8">8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Jesus returns, the promises about God’s Kingdom will be completely fulfilled. Jesus will bring judgment and destruction for Satan and his angels (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.20">Rom 16:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-12">2 Thes 2:3-12</a>).

He will give his people a priceless inheritance (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.4">1 Pet 1:4</a>) and new eternal bodies (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-57">1 Cor 15:35-57</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Phil 3:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-18">1 Thes 4:13-18</a>).

<p class="theme-body">In light of these promises, believers in Jesus are to prayerfully await his return (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.10">Matt 6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.20">Rev 22:20</a>). We should not speculate on dates for his coming (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.32">Mark 13:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.7">Acts 1:7</a>), but should live in a way that is honorable (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.28">1 Jn 2:28</a>) and be prepared (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.36-25.30">Matt 24:36–25:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-11">1 Thes 5:1-11</a>).</p>

<title>Jesus’ Final Night</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Jesus’ Final Night</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When Jesus went into Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, he knew it was his final night. He had come to Jerusalem to “suffer many terrible things and . . . be killed” (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mark 8:31</a>). His disciples had prepared the meal, but he needed to prepare them for what was coming.</p>
<p class="theme-body">So Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples. At this meal, Jesus demonstrated true servanthood by washing his disciples’ feet (<a href="?bref=John.13.1-20">John 13:1-20</a>). He gave his final teachings to the disciples, informed them about the coming of the Holy Spirit, and prayed for his followers (<a href="?bref=John.14.1-17.26">John 14:1–17:26</a>). Jesus also established the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-24">Mark 14:22-24</a>). Jesus was now the Passover Lamb—his body and blood are now the sacrifice that saves his people from judgment, fulfilling the same purpose as the lamb at the first Passover.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It was on Passover that God had struck down all the firstborn males of Egypt but had spared those of Israel. Now Jesus would be struck down so that his people could be spared—just as the prophets had predicted (e.g., <a href="?bref=Zech.12.10">Zech 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.7">13:7</a>). Jesus warned his disciples that this was about to happen and that they were about to desert him (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.27">Mark 14:27</a>). Jesus also warned his disciples that he would be betrayed by one of them (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.18">Mark 14:18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">After the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives, where Jesus prayed in agony, submitting his will to the Father (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.26-42">Mark 14:26-42</a>). Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, then approached with a group of soldiers, who arrested Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.43-49">Mark 14:43-49</a>). Jesus’ disciples fled (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.50-52">Mark 14:50-52</a>), and Jesus was taken to the house of the high priest for an overnight trial, during which Peter denied Jesus three times (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.53-72">Mark 14:53-72</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">While Jesus’ final night was marked by tragedy, nothing that happened was outside of his foreknowledge. Everything occurred according to God’s plan and was necessary in order to fulfill Scripture and to usher in the events which followed (his death and resurrection).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Praise and Rejoicing in Luke—Acts</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout Luke’s Gospel, the recipients of God’s grace praise him for his wonderful deeds (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.44">Luke 1:44</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46">46</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.1.64">64</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.1.68">68</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.13">2:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.2.38">38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.25-26">5:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.13">13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.15-18">17:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.43">18:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.37">19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.53">24:53</a>). In Acts, praise accompanies healings (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.8-9">3:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.21-22">4:21-22</a>) and the salvation of the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.18">Acts 11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.48">13:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.19-20">21:19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">This motif of praise is closely linked to a key theme in Luke, that the fulfillment of God’s promise in the coming of Jesus the Messiah is a cause for joy and rejoicing. This theme emerges toward the beginning of the Gospel in the songs of Mary (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Luke 1:46-55</a>) and Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.67-79">Luke 1:67-79</a>). The Old Testament prophets had predicted that nature itself would break forth in songs of praise when God’s salvation arrived (see <a href="?bref=Isa.55.12">Isa 55:12</a>). When Jesus entered Jerusalem at the end of his ministry, his disciples shouted and sang, “praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen” (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.37">Luke 19:37</a>). The Pharisees called on Jesus to rebuke his disciples, but he responded, “If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.37-40">19:37-40</a>). At the end of the Gospel, the disciples “returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy. And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.52-53">24:52-53</a>). The arrival of God’s marvelous salvation is a cause for rejoicing and praise.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Birth of Christ</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The accounts of the birth of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-2.12">Matt 1:18–2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.44-47">Luke 2:1-20</a>) are a study in contrasts. On the one side is the lowliness of the birth. A poor peasant couple makes their way to their ancestral home of Bethlehem to register for a census imposed on them by the oppressive Roman Empire. Their journey is a long and hard one from Galilee, and when they arrive they can find no place of lodging. They are consigned to a place reserved for animals. There is a sense of poverty, rejection, and obscurity. At the birth of the child, announcements are sent not to great kings or to the rich and powerful, but to lowly shepherds watching their flocks in a field.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Yet beside this humble lowliness is a message of unspeakable power and grandeur. The child who is laid in a manger is the Messiah, the long-awaited descendant of King David. He will reign triumphant over the people of Israel and his kingdom will never end. He is the one spoken about by all the prophets. All of history has been pointing forward to its climax in him. A group of wise men from the East come to pay homage to him. And an army of mighty angels comes from heaven to announce his birth.</p>
<p class="theme-body">These contrasts are a foretaste of things to come. In Jesus, the God of Israel and Lord of all the earth has come to visit and to save his people. The Divine One reaches down to meet them where they are. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus will show special concern for the lowly, the poor, the outcast, and sinners. These are the ones he has come to save because they recognize their need for him. They receive the message of salvation with joy and rejoicing.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The contrast between lowliness and exaltation also relates to Jesus’ mission. Though wicked people reject him and put him to death, Jesus is vindicated at his resurrection and exalted to the right hand of God, where he reigns as Lord and Messiah. From there he pours out the Spirit of God to guide and direct his church. Through his life, death, resurrection, and exaltation, Jesus provides forgiveness of sins and eternal life to all those who respond in faith to him.</p>

<title>Hope for the Messiah</title>
<refs>Luke.3.15</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Hope for the Messiah</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the first century, many Jews eagerly looked for the coming of the Messiah, a deliverer who would defeat Israel’s enemies and usher in an era of peace and prosperity for God’s people.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">Messiah</span> is equivalent to the Greek word <span class="greek">Christ</span>—both mean “Anointed One.” The term comes from the practice of anointing Israelite kings with oil at their enthronement to confirm their appointment to rule the nation as God’s representative. Thus the term came to refer to the future king that Israel hoped for. There was widespread hope that a king from David’s line would reestablish David’s dynasty and reign in righteousness and justice on David’s throne in Jerusalem. This hope had its foundation in <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.11-16">2 Sam 7:11-16</a>, where God promised King David that he would raise up descendants after him and establish his throne forever. With the decline and subsequent collapse of Israel as a kingdom, the Old Testament prophets predicted the coming of the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6-7">Isa 9:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">11:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.15-16">33:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.24-25">Ezek 37:24-25</a>), the king who would deliver God’s people and reign forever on David’s throne.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Gospel writers take a special interest in showing that Jesus is truly the promised Messiah (see e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21-23">Matt 1:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.32-33">Luke 1:32-33</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.1.69-70">69-70</a>), but that he has fulfilled the messianic promises in a surprising way. After Peter confessed that Jesus is “the Messiah sent from God,” Jesus immediately began teaching about the Messiah’s suffering (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.20-22">Luke 9:20-22</a>). As Jesus approached Jerusalem for the last time, he was recognized as the King coming in the name of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.36-38">Luke 18:36-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.36-38">19:36-38</a>), but then he was rejected (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.66-71">Luke 22:66-71</a>) and crucified, mocked as “king of the Jews” and “God’s Messiah” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.35-39">Luke 23:35-39</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">On the third day, however, Jesus rose victorious from the dead, just as he predicted. During his appearances to the disciples he revealed that the Scriptures predicted all along that “the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.26">24:26</a>). Jesus’ death and resurrection confirm that he is truly the Messiah and that his death brings restoration and forgiveness of sins (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.46-47">24:46-47</a>).</p>

<title>The Suffering Prophet</title>
<refs>Luke.4.22-24</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Suffering Prophet</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus is described by many titles in the Gospels, including Messiah, Son of David, Son of Man, Son of God, and Lord. In Luke, a key title is “Prophet.” Jesus was the prophet that Moses predicted in <a href="?bref=Deut.18.15">Deut 18:15</a>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">As a prophet, Jesus preached God’s word and performed miracles like those of the great Old Testament prophets. When Jesus raised a widow’s son, the people cried out, “A mighty prophet has risen among us” (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">Luke 7:16</a>). The disiples reported to Jesus that people were identifying him as a prophet (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-14">Matt 16:13-14</a>). And the disciples on the Emmaus road identified him as “a prophet who did powerful miracles” and “a mighty teacher” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.19">Luke 24:19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Like other prophets, Jesus suffered for his testimony (cp. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-18">1 Kgs 19:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.18-19">Jer 11:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.18">18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.1-2">20:1-2</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.20.7-18">7-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.26.7-11">26:7-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.26.20-23">20-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.38.1-6">38:1-6</a>). While the people linked Jesus’ prophetic office to his miracles and teaching, Jesus connected it especially to his suffering. At Nazareth, he affirmed that “no prophet is accepted in his own hometown” (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.24">Luke 4:24</a>), and he later accused Israel’s leaders of murdering their prophets (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.47-51">11:47-51</a>). As he journeyed to Jerusalem, he exclaimed, “It wouldn’t do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.33">13:33</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, when Israel did not heed God’s prophets, divine judgment followed. Similarly, God’s people would face judgment if they did not listen to Jesus (see <a href="?bref=Acts.3.22-23">Acts 3:22-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Just as the revelation that Jesus is the Messiah confirms that he is the Savior for all people, so his role as prophet confirms that his message comes from God, and his words are the authentic word of God, which must be heard and obeyed.</p>

<title>Jesus’ Prayers</title>
<refs>Luke.11.1-13</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Jesus’ Prayers</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In Luke’s Gospel, Jesus prayed at critical events in his life: at his baptism (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.21">3:21</a>), before calling the Twelve (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.12">6:12</a>), at the Transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-29">9:28-29</a>), for Peter before his denial (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.32">22:32</a>), and for his murderers from the cross (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.34">23:34</a>). At times, Jesus withdrew from others so that he could pray alone (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.23">Matt 14:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.35">Mark 1:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.16">Luke 5:16</a>). He also taught the disciples to pray (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.1-4">Luke 11:1-4</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.6.5-13">Matt 6:5-13</a>) and told parables about the need for persistent prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.5-13">Luke 11:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.1-8">18:1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus’ prayers are part of Luke’s emphasis on the intimacy between the Father and the Son. Jesus lived in communion with the Father, followed the Father’s purpose, and remained faithful to the Father’s will. In Gethsemane, Jesus agonized over the suffering that lay ahead, but he prayed, “I want your will to be done, not mine” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.42">Luke 22:42</a>). On the cross, he expressed total dependence on the Father, uttering as his last words, “Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.46">Luke 23:46</a>). Jesus modeled for us a life of trust and dependence on our heavenly Father.</p>
<p class="theme-body">John records a prayer of Jesus on his final night with the disciples, often referred to as the High Priestly Prayer (<a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">John 17:1-26</a>). In this prayer, Jesus intercedes for his followers, praying for their protection, understanding, holiness, and unity.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Messianic Banquet</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Through his teaching and miracles, Jesus announced that the messianic banquet was about to be served. All may come and feast at the table of salvation in God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus described his ministry as a wedding feast, with himself as the groom (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.33-35">Luke 5:33-35</a>) and the Kingdom of God as a great banquet. All were invited, but some refused to come (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.15-24">Luke 14:15-24</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.8.11-12">Matt 8:11-12</a>). Jesus often ate with diverse people, from despised tax collectors to pious Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.29-32">5:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">7:36-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.37-41">11:37-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.1-6">14:1-6</a>). Jesus also used imagery of feasting and banquets in his teaching and parables (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.33-35">5:33-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.35-38">12:35-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.7-14">14:7-14</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.14.15-24">15-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.7-10">17:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.28-30">22:28-30</a>). And he fed vast multitudes with a few loaves and fishes (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.10-17">9:10-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Old Testament background to this feasting imagery is <a href="?bref=Isa.25.6">Isa 25:6</a>, where God’s final salvation is described as a great feast for all people: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies will spread a wonderful feast for all the people of the world. It will be a delicious banquet, with clear, well-aged wine and choice meat” (see also <a href="?bref=Isa.65.13-14">Isa 65:13-14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus’ public ministry marked the invitation to the banquet and its inauguration. Through his death and resurrection, he achieved salvation. All people can now come to God’s banquet table and receive the spiritual blessings of the Kingdom. At the same time, this banquet awaits its final consummation in the future Kingdom, when Jesus’ disciples will “eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom” and “sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.30">Luke 22:30</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rev.19.7-9">Rev 19:7-9</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Rich and Poor in the Gospel of Luke</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout Luke’s Gospel, a reversal of worldly fortunes characterizes entrance into, or exclusion from, the Kingdom of God. Mary announced that God would lift up the poor and humble and bring down the rich and powerful (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.52-53">1:52-53</a>). Jesus announced at Nazareth that the gospel is “Good News to the poor” (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">4:18</a>). He pronounced blessings on the poor and hungry, and woes against the rich and satisfied (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.20-26">6:20-26</a>). This was a reversal of conventional wisdom, which held that God had blessed the rich and cursed the poor.</p>
<p class="theme-body">A number of Jesus’ parables severely warn against the danger of riches. The parable of the rich fool (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.13-21">12:13-21</a>) reveals the consequence of storing up treasures on earth instead of having a rich relationship with God. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">16:19-31</a>) shows the eternal cost of ignoring the poor and helpless while enjoying the good things in life. The rich man who asked Jesus the way to eternal life was devastated when Jesus said he must sell all that he had and give to the poor (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.18-23">18:18-23</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Who are the poor in Luke’s Gospel? Are they the physically poor or those that are poor in spirit (cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.3">Matt 5:3</a>)? Almost certainly it is both. The physically poor, who have very little, are naturally dependent on God for their needs. The rich and powerful are likely to be self-sufficient, forgetting their need for God. It is impossible for rich people to enter God’s Kingdom as long as they trust in their riches to get them there (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.25-26">16:25-26</a>). God accepts those who put their faith in him alone.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Climax of Scripture</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The account of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus is significant not only as a resurrection appearance—and so as proof of Jesus’ victory over death—but also as a key moment of revelation concerning the role of the Messiah and the Old Testament prophecies about him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The two disciples pointed out to their anonymous traveling companion that this man named Jesus had shown himself to be a great prophet through his teaching and miracles. But they had hoped that he might be even more—the Messiah! Their hopes were shattered, however, when he was arrested and crucified.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus responded by rebuking them for not reading the Scriptures attentively enough. The suffering of the Messiah was predicted all along in Scripture. Luke then relates how Jesus took the two disciples on a tour of Scripture, explaining to them “from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.27">Luke 24:27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although Jesus does not specify which Old Testament passages speak of the suffering Messiah, various texts are cited elsewhere. Jesus is the rejected stone that becomes the cornerstone, the foundation for a new temple of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.118.22">Ps 118:22</a>, cited in <a href="?bref=Luke.20.17">Luke 20:17</a>); the suffering Servant of the Lord, who is treated like a common criminal (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">Isa 53:12</a>, cited in <a href="?bref=Luke.22.37">Luke 22:37</a>) and who is mocked, insulted and spit upon by his opponents (<a href="?bref=Isa.50.6">Isa 50:6</a>, alluded to in <a href="?bref=Luke.18.32">Luke 18:32</a>); the anointed king rejected by rulers and the people of Israel, but vindicated by God (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-2">Ps 2:1–2</a>, cited in <a href="?bref=Acts.4.25-28">Acts 4:25–28</a>); the descendant of David who will not be abandoned to the grave by God (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.8-11">Ps 16:8–11</a>, cited in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.25-28">Acts 2:25–28</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">According to <a href="?bref=Luke.24.27">Luke 24:27</a>, Jesus surveyed the whole story of Israel’s history and showed how it all leads to and climaxes in the coming of Jesus the Messiah, God’s agent of salvation. This is similar to how Paul describes Christ as having “accomplished the purpose for which the law was given” (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.4">Rom 10:4</a>). All the Old Testament Scriptures—including the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">Luke 24:44</a>)—point to God’s story of salvation, which reaches its climax and ultimate purpose in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Coming of the Spirit of God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God occasionally came upon individuals to empower them for God’s service and to prophesy (<a href="?bref=Num.24.2">Num 24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.10">Judg 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.10">1 Sam 10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.13">16:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.5">Ezek 11:5</a>). In the Judaism of Jesus’ day, there was a widespread belief that the Spirit of prophecy had departed from Israel with the last of the Old Testament prophets. But the prophets had predicted that when God’s salvation arrived, he would pour out his Spirit on all people (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">Isa 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.26-27">Ezek 36:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Joel 2:28-32</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">This prophecy finds its initial fulfillment in the birth narrative in Luke. The Holy Spirit inspired prophetic witness and guided the events of Jesus’ birth. John the Baptist was filled with the Spirit even before he was born (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.15">Luke 1:15</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.1.41">41</a>), and Zechariah broke forth in a Spirit-filled hymn of praise to God (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.67">1:67</a>). Mary conceived Jesus and prophesied through the power of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">1:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">1:46-55</a>), and Simeon was led by the Spirit to the Temple to see the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.25-27">2:25-27</a>). Later in his life, Jesus was anointed by the Spirit at his baptism and empowered to accomplish his role as the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.21-22">3:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1">4:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Following his ascension, Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies by pouring out his Spirit on his disciples on the Day of Pentecost, empowering them to take the Good News of salvation to the ends of the earth (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.49">Luke 24:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.4">2:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.2.17-18">17-18</a>). Throughout Acts, the church accomplished its mission through the guidance, power, and direction of the Holy Spirit. The coming of the Spirit marks the beginning of God’s salvation—God’s presence and power now reside with his people.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Word</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">John raises the curtain on his Gospel with a stunning description of Jesus Christ as “the Word” (Greek <span class="greek">logos</span><span class="ital">,</span> <a href="?bref=John.1.1">John 1:1</a>). Both Greek and Jewish listeners in the first century would immediately recognize the profound meaning of this title. Greeks would have thought of the seminal forces that sustain the universe. Jewish minds would have thought back to God creating the world with his word (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.3-28">Gen 1:3-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6">Ps 33:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.33.9">9</a>). In Jesus’ day, the Word of God had taken on creative personal attributes. Jews viewed God’s Word as personifying divine Wisdom. Through Wisdom, God extended himself into the cosmos, creating the world (<a href="?bref=Pr.8.22-31">Prov 8:22-31</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">John makes it clear that Jesus shares the same essence as God; the Son existed before time, and he was the agent of all creation. John anchors the divinity of Jesus in this ancient Jewish concept of Wisdom. The divine Wisdom that has existed with God from before time can now be known in Jesus Christ. In perhaps the most striking verse penned by an apostle, John writes that this Logos, this Wisdom, became flesh and lived among us as a human (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>). What God is, the Logos is, and the Logos is Jesus Christ.</p>

<refs>John.2.1-11</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Miraculous Signs in the Gospel of John</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Gospels use three words to describe Jesus’ miraculous works. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Greek word <span class="greek">dunamis</span> (“power”) describes an act of raw force that amazes observers and leads to the inevitable conclusion that God must be at work in Jesus (see <a href="?bref=Mark.6.2">Mark 6:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">John, however, does not use the popular term <span class="greek">dunamis</span> in relation to Jesus’ miracles. Instead, he labels each of Jesus’ miracles as a “sign” (Greek <span class="greek">sēmeion</span>), an event that has a deeper meaning. John also describes Jesus’ miracles as “works” (Greek <span class="greek">erga</span>, see <a href="?bref=John.10.38">John 10:38</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.7.3">7:3</a>, translated “miracles”; <a href="?bref=John.9.3">9:3</a>, translated “power”). Christ’s miracles were part of the work that God gave him to do (<a href="?bref=John.17.4">17:4</a>), revealing the Father to the world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">John selectively records seven miraculous signs that occurred during Jesus’ ministry: (1) changing water to wine (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-11">2:1-11</a>); (2) healing an official’s son (<a href="?bref=John.4.46-54">4:46-54</a>); (3) healing a paralyzed man (<a href="?bref=John.5.1-17">5:1-17</a>); (4) feeding five thousand (<a href="?bref=John.6.1-15">6:1-15</a>); (5) walking on water (<a href="?bref=John.6.16-21">6:16-21</a>); (6) healing a blind man (<a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">9:1-41</a>); and (7) raising Lazarus from the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.1-44">11:1-44</a>). John also records a miraculous catch of fish after Jesus’ resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.21.4-14">21:4-14</a>). Most of the seven signs were met with belief (<a href="?bref=John.2.11">2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.53">4:53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.45-48">11:45-48</a>). However, Jesus’ purposes extended beyond the signs themselves. The miraculous signs are like physical roadsigns: They are messages that point to a greater reality. Thus, a miraculous sign is usually accompanied by a discourse from Jesus in which he explains the truth that the sign points to. For example, Jesus fed the five thousand not just to meet their needs but also so that people would see him as the bread of life (<a href="?bref=John.6.35">6:35</a>), given for them when he died on the cross (<a href="?bref=John.6.51">6:51</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">“Belief” in the Gospel of John</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Believing occupies a central place in John’s Gospel. John does not use the noun <span class="ital">faith</span> that appears frequently elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., see <a href="?bref=Matt.8.8-10">Matt 8:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.22">Mark 11:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.21">Acts 20:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.27-31">3:27-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.3-5">4:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-39">Heb 11:1-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-24">Jas 2:14-24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.5-7">1 Pet 1:5-7</a>). John prefers the verb <span class="ital">believe</span> to underscore that faith is not simply a static dogma, but is dynamic, requiring action. In John’s Gospel, “believing” in Jesus is the trait of all true disciples.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Gospel of John, the verb translated “believe” is often followed by the Greek preposition <span class="greek">eis</span> (“into”). No parallel exists for this combination in ancient Greek usage. For John, faith is not a status, but an investment in the person of Jesus. Faith means accepting who Jesus is and what he claims to be. Faith constitutes a commitment to let his call change the way we live. Faith is the work God wants from us (<a href="?bref=John.6.29">John 6:29</a>), demonstrated as we abide in Jesus’ word, as we love him, and as we obey his commands (<a href="?bref=John.8.31">John 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.1-17">15:1-17</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.10">1 Jn 5:10</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Living Water</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In Israel, a land that frequently experienced drought, people were keenly aware of water sources and water quality. Springs and rivers that ran all year were few, so the people relied on cisterns to catch and store the winter rains and wells to tap underground water tables. In Jewish culture, “dead water” referred to standing or stored water. “Living water” referred to moving water, as in rivers, springs, and rainfall. Such water was precious because it was fresh. And because it came directly from God, it was used for ritual washings (see <a href="?bref=Lev.14.5-6">Lev 14:5-6</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.14.50-51">50-51</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.15.13">15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.19.17-19">Num 19:17-19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The distinction between “dead” and “living” water helps explain why the woman of Samaria was so perplexed when Jesus offered her living water (<a href="?bref=John.4.12">John 4:12</a>). Samaria has no permanent river. If Jacob had to dig a well there, how could Jesus offer superior water?</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus mentioned living water again in Jerusalem at the autumn Festival of Shelters (<a href="?bref=John.7.37-39">7:37-39</a>). This festival, which fell during a dry time of year, included an emphasis on water. In this setting, Jesus stepped forward and made an extravagant claim: Anyone looking for living water should come to him and drink. Jesus is the source of living water; he came directly from God and brought divine renewal through the Spirit.</p>

<p class="theme-title">John’s Profile of Discipleship</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the first half of his Gospel, John tells about a variety of people who model true discipleship (see <a href="?bref=John.1.19-51">John 1:19-51</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.1-42">4:1-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">9:1-41</a>). Through them John provides a profile of the mature follower, or “disciple,” of Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">What is the profile of a disciple? (1) <span class="ital">Disciples know who Jesus is.</span> In each of these three accounts, Jesus is identified correctly (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=John.1.34">1:34</a>, <a href="?bref=John.1.36">36</a>, <a href="?bref=John.1.38">38</a>, <a href="?bref=John.1.41">41</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.19">4:19</a>, <a href="?bref=John.4.29">29</a>, <a href="?bref=John.4.31">31</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.2">9:2</a>, <a href="?bref=John.9.17">17</a>, <a href="?bref=John.9.35-38">35-38</a>). (2) <span class="ital">Disciples believe in Jesus.</span> They see Jesus’ mighty works, listen to his profound words, and believe (see <a href="?bref=John.1.49">1:49</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.39-42">4:39-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.35-38">9:35-38</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.20.8">20:8</a>, <a href="?bref=John.20.24-29">24-29</a>).

Following implies genuine devotion, leaving what we have to embrace the journey with Jesus.</p>
<p class="theme-body">John provided this profile of true discipleship because he wanted his readers to join these courageous men and women and become disciples of Jesus as well (see <a href="?bref=John.20.30-31">20:30-31</a>).</p>

<title>Our Advocate</title>
<refs>John.14.15-31</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Our Advocate</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">On four occasions in the Gospel of John, the unusual Greek word <span class="greek">paraklētos</span> (“called alongside,” “advocate”) is used to describe the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.14.16">John 14:16</a>, <a href="?bref=John.14.26">26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.7">16:7</a>). This term occurs elsewhere in Greek literature, where it refers to a legal advocate—someone who speaks in a person’s defense and provides legal counsel. “Counselor” is a popular translation of this term, but the therapeutic connotations of this word in contemporary English are misleading; the older legal meaning of a lawyer providing advice or counsel is closer to the mark. “Comforter” is another popular translation, but this can also be misleading; the older English meaning of someone who strengthens (an “encourager”) is more accurate to the New Testament concept of <span class="greek">paraklētos</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus described the Spirit as <span class="ital">another</span> Advocate (<a href="?bref=John.14.16">14:16</a>). Jesus, who is the first advocate (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 Jn 2:1</a>), sent a second Advocate, the Holy Spirit. Every task of the Spirit described in <a href="?bref=John.14.1-16.33">John 14–16</a> is a task Jesus undertook elsewhere in the Gospel. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would come to encourage, instruct, and strengthen his followers. In fact, the Spirit would sustain Jesus’ own presence among his disciples. Five promises about the Spirit each indicate a different work that the Spirit does (<a href="?bref=John.14.16-17">John 14:16-17</a>, <a href="?bref=John.14.26">26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.7-8">16:7-8</a>, <a href="?bref=John.16.13-14">13-14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Spirit became available to Jesus’ disciples after his death (see <a href="?bref=John.7.39">7:39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.22">20:22</a>).

<title>“I Am” Sayings of Jesus</title>
<refs>John.14.6</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title"> “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>” Sayings of Jesus</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Numerous times in the Gospel of John, Jesus uses the expression “I am” (rendered in Greek as <span class="greek">egō eimi</span>). Sometimes it comes as a simple self-description such as “I am the bread of life.” John has seven of these statements that have “I am” followed by a predicate (<a href="?bref=John.6.35">6:35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.9">10:9</a>, <a href="?bref=John.10.11">11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.1">15:1</a>). One thing important to note is that Greek does not require the use of the pronoun “I” (<span class="greek">egō</span>) in these sentences. Thus, the presence of the pronoun emphasizes the identity of the speaker. As an example from another Gospel, Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount, “You have heard that it was said . . . but <span class="ital">I </span>[<span class="greek">egō</span>] say” (see <a href="?bref=Matt.5.22">Matt 5:22</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.28">28</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.32">32</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.34">34</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.39">39</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.44">44</a>, etc.). The inclusion of the personal pronoun sharpens the contrast between Jesus’ instruction and that of Moses. This remarkable phrase underscores the authority of Jesus.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At other times, Jesus’ use of “I am” is grammatically odd, occurring without a predicate. For example, “Before Abraham was even born, <span class="divine-name">I Am</span>” (<a href="?bref=John.8.58">John 8:58</a>). <span class="ital">Before Abraham, Jesus was what?</span> (cp. <a href="?bref=John.8.28">8:28</a>, <a href="?bref=John.8.59">59</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.19">13:19</a>). The best explanation of this odd expression comes from the Old Testament. When Moses met the Lord on Mount Sinai, he was eager to discover God’s name (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6">Exod 3:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.3.13-14">13-14</a>). God tells him that his name is <span class="divine-name">Yhwh</span>, four Hebrew letters that express existence. When the Old Testament was later translated into Greek, this name for God was translated as “<span class="greek">egō eimi</span>”—emphatic “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>.” The Greek Old Testament continued to use this title (see <a href="?bref=Isa.43.25">Isa 43:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.12">51:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.6">52:6</a>). Any Jewish reader who knew the Old Testament would understand what Jesus meant when he employed the divine “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus not only represents God. The “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>” statements demonstrate Jesus’ divine status and showing that he can work, speak, and act in the Father’s stead. He is no mere man. He is the Word of God dwelling in human flesh. His voice is the voice of the Father, and his life is the life of God made visible in human form. The use of the expression “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>” is thus a striking and powerful way to express who Jesus is.</p>

<title>Remaining in Christ</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Remaining in Christ</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Greek term <span class="greek">menō</span><span class="ital">,</span> often translated “remain,” “stay,” or “abide,” occurs frequently in relation to Jesus’ descriptions of profound, intimate, and enduring relationships. For example, Jesus said, “You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to [<span class="greek">menō en,</span> ‘stay in’] my teachings” (<a href="?bref=John.8.31">John 8:31</a>). The idea is that a disciple’s life is fully formed by Jesus’ word. Jesus also described how the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (<a href="?bref=John.14.10-11">John 14:10-11</a>). Likewise, when we remain in Christ, the Son is in us and we are in the Father and the Son (<a href="?bref=John.17.21-23">17:21-23</a>). Both the Father and the Son come and make their home within disciples.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This mutual indwelling is precisely what it means that the disciple remains in Christ. We cannot gain the permanence of our relationship by our own effort; this relationship is only made permanent by the gracious initiative of God indwelling our lives through his Spirit. This means commitment on the part of both God and the disciple. The mutual indwelling between God and the believer is not a fleeting or temporary commitment, but an enduring, permanent, and eternal relationship (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.14">1 Jn 2:14</a>, <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.17">17</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The World</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">One of the most frequently used words in John is “world” (Greek <span class="greek">kosmos</span>). In Greek-speaking Jewish thought, <span class="greek">kosmos</span> refers to the heavens and the earth as created by God (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Gen 1</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.1.3">John 1:3</a>, <a href="?bref=John.1.10">10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.5">17:5</a>, <a href="?bref=John.17.24">24</a>). John extends the concept to include the world of humanity (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.1.10">1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.16">3:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although it was created as good, the human world is hostile to God (<a href="?bref=John.1.10-11">1:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.19-20">3:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.37-41">12:37-41</a>). It is controlled by a darkness that cannot comprehend the light and, in fact, resists the light (<a href="?bref=John.3.19">3:19</a>). The world is dead and needs life (<a href="?bref=John.6.33">6:33</a>, <a href="?bref=John.6.51">51</a>), yet it hates the one who can save it (<a href="?bref=John.7.7">7:7</a>). The world is under the dominion of Satan (<a href="?bref=John.12.31">12:31</a>), who will one day be judged.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God loves the world of humanity, despite its hostility and rebellion against him. Jesus died to take away the sin of the world (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">1:29</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.16-17">3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>). But God’s love for the world he created stands alongside his necessary judgment of the world (<a href="?bref=John.3.18-21">John 3:18-21</a>, <a href="?bref=John.3.36">36</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.27-30">5:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.47-48">12:47-48</a>). Christ’s followers experience this same tension in their mission. We are called into the world to bring the message of God’s love, but we will experience conflict because the world will be hostile to our message (see <a href="?bref=John.15.18-27">15:18-27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.13-26">17:13-26</a>).</p>

<title>The Cross and Passover</title>
<refs>John.19.17-36</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Cross and Passover</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">At the beginning of John’s Gospel, John the Baptist introduced Jesus by calling him the “Lamb of God” (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">John 1:29</a>, <a href="?bref=John.1.36">36</a>). This phrase might be a reference to the sacrificial lamb that was killed daily in the Temple (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.38-46">Exod 29:38-46</a>) or to the sacrificial lamb of <a href="?bref=Isa.53.7">Isaiah 53:7</a> (cp. <a href="?bref=Acts.8.32-35">Acts 8:32-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.5-14">Rev 5:5-14</a>). Both of these sacrifices spoke of rescue and forgiveness from sin.</p>
<p class="theme-body">However, this was not all that John had in mind. John presented Jesus as the Passover lamb whose death marks the central event of the Passover season (see <a href="?bref=Exod.12.43-47">Exod 12:43-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.7">Luke 22:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>). In the first century, Jews made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem each spring to celebrate the Passover and to reread the story of the Exodus (see <a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-15.27">Exod 12–15</a>). When Israel was being rescued from Egypt, the blood of a lamb was sprinkled on the doorposts of each Jewish home in Egypt, an act which saved those inside from death (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-51">Exod 12</a>). Jews who came to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover needed to supply a perfect young lamb for sacrifice (the animal could not be diseased or have broken bones).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus used his final Passover meal to show that his sacrificial death would give new meaning to the festival (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.17-25">Mark 14:17-25</a>). At his crucifixion, Jesus’ legs were not broken, as was often done to fulfill a Passover rule (<a href="?bref=John.19.31-33">John 19:31-33</a>; see <a href="?bref=Exod.12.46">Exod 12:46</a>). Blood ran freely from his wound (<a href="?bref=John.19.34">John 19:34</a>), showing that his life was being exchanged for others. Just as a lamb died to save the lives of Jewish families at the Passover in Egypt, so too, the death of the Son of God on the cross serves to bring salvation to the world.</p>

<title>Fishing in Galilee</title>
<refs>John.21.1-14</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Fishing in Galilee</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus’ knowledge of fishing is evident throughout the four Gospels. The fishing trade provided Jesus with raw materials for parables (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.10">Matt 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.47-51">13:47-51</a>) as well as a job description for his apostles (“to fish for people,” <a href="?bref=Matt.4.19">Matt 4:19</a>). In <a href="?bref=John.21.1-25">John 21</a>, Jesus uses fishing to reveal himself to his apostles following his resurrection.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Commercial fishermen in ancient Galilee fished exclusively with nets. Three types of nets were in use:</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="bold">The drag net</span> was the most ancient kind of net. A wall-like net with weights on the bottom and cork floats on the top was first pulled along the coast. Then the lead rope was swept across the sea by boat and pulled back to shore. The drag net pulled in many fish that could not be eaten under Jewish law. The fish were sorted, the good kept, and the bad thrown out. Jesus used the image of the drag net to describe the day of judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.47-51">Matt 13:47-51</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="bold">The cast net</span> was circular and measured fifteen to twenty feet across. It had lead weights attached to its edges and was tossed into the sea by a lone fisherman. It landed, sank, and caught unwary fish. The fisherman then dove into the water and either pulled the fish out individually or gathered the net and lifted it into the boat. Simon and Andrew were using cast nets when Jesus called them (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-20">Matt 4:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-18">Mark 1:16-18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="bold">The trammel net</span>, the only type still used today, is a compound net built from three layers of net. The two outer nets are identical and have wide openings while the inner net is finely meshed and loose, flowing easily in and out of the outer nets. The net is spread in the water in a long line, usually at night, and held while other fishermen scare the fish toward it. The fish enter the first outer net easily, push against the fine mesh inner net and then carry the fine net into the second outer net, entangling themselves hopelessly. The net is then hauled ashore, the fish are disentangled and sorted, and the many breaks in the net are repaired. When Jesus called James and John to follow him, they were repairing their trammel nets (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-22">Matt 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.19-20">Mark 1:19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"> When Jesus instructed Simon to let down his net again after fishing all night, a miraculous catch of fish convicted Simon (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1-11">Luke 5:1-11</a>). A similar event occurred in <a href="?bref=John.21.1-11">John 21:1-11</a> when Simon Peter returned from a fruitless night and Jesus told him to throw out his net once more. Peter likely grabbed a cast net, which was then filled with so many fish it was difficult to haul in.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Jesus’ Ascension</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus’ ascension into heaven was a final commissioning service for the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-11">Acts 1:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.45-53">Luke 24:45-53</a>).

<refs>Acts.1.8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Holy Spirit’s Presence</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The book of Acts clearly highlights the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Before the coming of the Spirit, Jesus spoke of the Spirit’s influence on his followers (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a>; see <a href="?bref=John.14.15-17">John 14:15-17</a>, <a href="?bref=John.14.26">26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.7-15">16:7-15</a>). The Spirit’s guidance was clear in the selection of Spirit-filled leaders to care for the needs of the Hellenistic widows (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-7">Acts 6:1-7</a>) and in the appointing of Barnabas and Saul for missionary service (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-5">13:1-5</a>). When the first church council met to consider the membership of Gentiles in the church, those present followed the Spirit’s direction (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.28">15:28</a>). Christian workers such as Stephen and Philip were filled with the Spirit and preached by his power (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-8.40">6:1–8:40</a>), and Paul’s ministry was charged with the Spirit’s energy from the beginning (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.17">9:17</a>). In Acts, the growth, development, and expansion of the church took place entirely under the guidance and power of the Spirit (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.2.4">2:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.2.41-47">41-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.31">4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.32">5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.15">8:15</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.8.17">17</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.8.29">29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.31">9:31</a>). Because of the prominence of the Spirit’s work in Acts, the book has often been called “the Acts of the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Holy Spirit works in many ways. He gives and restores life (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gen 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.24-30">Ps 104:24-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-14">Ezek 37:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Joel 2:28-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.9-11">Rom 8:9-11</a>). He calls and commissions workers for the service of Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.2">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">20:28</a>) and guides God’s servants where and when he wants, to do as he desires (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.29">8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.19-20">10:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.12">11:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">16:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.13">1 Cor 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.12">1 Pet 1:12</a>).

He bears witness to the power of the Good News in signs and wonders (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.3">Acts 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.4">Heb 2:4</a>), and teaches the truths of Scripture to God’s people (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.16">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.8">Heb 9:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.15-17">10:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11-12">1 Pet 1:11-12</a>).

He bestows gifts upon God’s people (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.4-11">1 Cor 12:4-11</a>), and he energizes and equips them to share the Good News, serve the Lord, and work for the Kingdom of God.</p>

<title>Baptism</title>
<refs>Acts.1.5</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Baptism</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Baptism was an important element of the Christian faith from the very beginning (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>). The words “baptism” and “baptize” were already used in Judaism to refer to a religious rite for cleansing. The law of Moses established the use of water to cleanse people from ceremonial defilement (<a href="?bref=Num.19.14-19">Num 19:14-19</a>). Later, Gentile converts to Judaism from pagan religions were admitted to Judaism only after fulfilling certain obligations, which included the study of the Torah, circumcision, and a ritual bath to wash away the impurities of their Gentile background. This ritual cleansing was often done in special baths created for purification, called mikvahs. Mikvahs were located at many synagogues, and the Temple in Jerusalem had a large number of mikvahs, which suggests that those who approached for worship would ritually bathe.</p>
<p class="theme-body">John preached “that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.3">Luke 3:3</a>). John’s baptism was an aspect of his role in preparing people’s hearts to receive the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.4-6">Luke 3:4-6</a>), and those who had received his baptism and repented of their sins were those who were prepared for Jesus’ message (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.29-30">Luke 7:29-30</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">After his resurrection, Jesus commanded his disciples to baptize new converts (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Matt 28:19</a>). Christian baptism is understood as dying and rising with Christ, signifying the death of the old life and the beginning of the new (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-4">Rom 6:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.12">Col 2:12</a>) and also signifying a Christian’s spiritual union with Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.27">Gal 3:27</a>) and with his church. Baptism thus became the rite of initiation in the Christian community. For this reason, many interpreters see baptism as the Christian equivalent of circumcision, the rite that initiated membership into the nation of Israel under the old covenant (see <a href="?bref=Col.2.11-12">Col 2:11-12</a>). Whatever the connection with OT circumcision, baptism signifies a changed heart and a clean conscience that come from God’s forgiveness (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.21">1 Pet 3:21</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Deut.10.16">Deut 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.6">30:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.4">Jer 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.28-29">Rom 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.3">Phil 3:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">As a ritual cleansing, Christian baptism signifies both forgiveness of sins (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.43">10:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.38">13:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.17-18">26:17-18</a>) and the reception of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.17-18">9:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.47-48">10:47-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.15-17">11:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.5-7">19:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Luke 3:16</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Growth of the Church</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The book of Acts outlines the church’s growth after Pentecost. In the early days there was <span class="bold">numerical growth</span>. After Jesus’ ascension, only 120 believers were present at the first prayer meeting seeking divine direction (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.12-15">Acts 1:12-15</a>). After the mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost, the number of Christians increased to about 3,000 (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.41">2:41</a>). Many more believed the preaching of Peter and John, and the number grew to about 5,000 (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.4">4:4</a>) and continued to rise (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.14">5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.31">9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.20">21:20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">There is also ample evidence of <span class="bold">geographical growth</span> (see <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.15">9:15</a>). The church was not confined to Jerusalem, as the message spread to Lydda, Sharon, and Joppa on the Mediterranean coast (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-43">9:32-43</a>). The message of salvation in Christ also moved out from its Jewish base into Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.4-12">8:4-12</a>), then into Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-26">11:19-26</a>). As Peter declared to Cornelius’s household, “God shows no favoritism” (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.34">10:34</a>). The message of Good News offers peace with God through Jesus Christ to all people (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.36">10:36</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">With the increase in numbers and the geographical spread of the faith, the Christian communities also experienced <span class="bold">spiritual growth</span> in depth and vitality. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.42-47">Acts 2:42-47</a> vividly depicts this development in the inner life of the church, featuring earnest, united prayer in crises, generous sharing of possessions, courage during persecution, and boldness in witness (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.23-31">4:23-31</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.4.32-37">32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.27-33">5:27-33</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.5.40-42">40-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.19-25">16:19-25</a>). Philip’s preaching, the manner of Stephen’s death, and Paul and Silas’s attitude in prison manifested a high standard of spiritual life and maturity (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.59-60">7:59-60</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.4-40">8:4-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.19-25">16:19-25</a>). Church leaders encouraged and strengthened believers, made them more steadfast in their faith, enabled them to face persecution (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.22">14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.32">15:32</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.41">41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.23">18:23</a>; see <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">2 Tim 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.1-9">2:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.12">3:12</a>), and lived by the standards they set for others (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.16">1 Cor 4:16</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.20">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.9">Phil 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.5-8">1 Thes 1:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.9">2 Thes 3:9</a>). The church’s sensitive handling of the Gentiles’ inclusion also resulted in significant spiritual (and numerical) growth: “So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day” (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.5">Acts 16:5</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Persecution</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Persecution is a common experience of God’s people. God’s servants have often faced hostility and opposition (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.30.7">Deut 30:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.13">1 Kgs 18:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-3">Neh 4:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.37.11-38.28">Jer 37:11–38:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.34-37">Matt 23:34-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.49-51">Luke 11:49-51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.14-16">1 Thes 2:14-16</a>). Jesus himself dealt with persecution (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.28-30">Luke 4:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.16">John 5:16</a>). At the end of his earthly life, he endured mocking, beating, and a horrible death by crucifixion, and he told his disciples to expect the same kind of treatment (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.16-25">Matt 10:16-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.9">24:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.9-13">Mark 13:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.12-17">Luke 21:12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.2">John 16:2</a>). He prepared his followers for such occasions, telling them that the Holy Spirit would give them the needed courage (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.11-12">Luke 12:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.14-15">21:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Acts documents the persecution of the earliest Christians, beginning with the hostility of the Jewish high council and the attacks of Saul of Tarsus on the early church prior to his encounter with Jesus near Damascus (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.3">Acts 8:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-13">9:1-13</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.9.21">21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.4">22:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.9-11">26:9-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.9">1 Cor 15:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.13">Gal 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.6">Phil 3:6</a>).

Persecution purifies God’s people and gives them the opportunity to conform more closely to the character of Jesus. The apostles’ experiences in Acts bear out Paul’s general statement: “Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.12">2 Tim 3:12</a>; see <a href="?bref=Mark.10.29-30">Mark 10:29-30</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Empowering Leadership</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-7">Acts 6:1-7</a> the new Christian community faced a crisis of leadership. The Hellenists, the Greek-speaking Jews in Jerusalem, were upset because the needs of their widows were being overlooked in “the daily distribution of food” (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">6:1</a>). This disruption threatened the development of the church with “rumblings of discontent” (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">6:1</a>) and had to be seriously addressed. Wisely, the apostles recognized the problem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.2-3">6:2-3</a>) and called for the selection of seven men to administer the food program (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.5-6">6:5-6</a>). Many interpreters see these seven as the first deacons (see <a href="?item=Acts.6.2-6_StudyNote_Filament">study note on 6:2-6</a>). A clear division of labor was agreed upon, with the apostles attending to preaching and teaching, and the material needs of the people being handled by other Spirit-filled leaders. The apostles provided empowering leadership by sensitively listening to genuine community needs. This wise handling of the issue, with the united, responsible action of all involved, resulted in spiritual growth and an increased number of believers (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.7">6:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Different gifts were recognized in the church and put to work for the common good (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.4-11">1 Cor 12:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.10-11">1 Pet 4:10-11</a>). And every believer has the opportunity to exercise some kind of ministry. This usefulness of every Christian in the service of God is sometimes called the “priesthood of all believers” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pet 2:5</a>, <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.6">Rev 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.10">5:10</a>; see <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Exod 19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.6">Isa 61:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.6">Rev 20:6</a>). Not everyone has the same role, but all have the same calling to use their gifts in God’s service.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God has given the church its leaders, not to “lord it over” other people, but to serve the community (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.25-28">Matt 20:25-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.42-45">Mark 10:42-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.25-27">Luke 22:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-4">1 Pet 5:1-4</a>). The leaders of the church do well when they recognize both the needs of the community and those whom God has prepared to meet those needs.

<p class="theme-title">Miracles</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Miracles occur frequently in the biblical narrative. They are particularly concentrated during the time of Moses and during the ministries of Elijah/Elisha, Jesus, and the apostles. The Bible does not attempt to prove miracles, but simply reports them. Miracles demonstrate both the power of God over the natural order and the compassion of God in response to human need. Miracles can lead to belief in God (<a href="?bref=John.2.23">John 2:23</a>), though they do not necessarily do so and though one must believe in more than the miracle itself (see <a href="?bref=John.12.37">John 12:37</a>). Miracles remind us of the truth that anything is possible for God (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.21-23">Mark 9:21-23</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.19.26">Matt 19:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.27">Mark 10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.37">Luke 1:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.27">18:27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus performed many miracles during his ministry including physical healings, exorcisms, nature miracles, and raising the dead. Jesus demonstrated a deep love for humankind in the way he responded to people’s needs, and many people followed him in response to his miracles (<a href="?bref=John.6.2">John 6:2</a>), though he cautioned against following him just because of the miracles (<a href="?bref=John.6.26">John 6:26</a>). Perhaps the three greatest miracles that occurred in relation to Jesus are (1) his coming as the Word of God in human flesh (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>), (2) his glorious resurrection from the dead (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-20">Matt 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1-8">Mark 16:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.1-53">Luke 24:1-53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.1-31">John 20:1-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.3">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3-8">1 Cor 15:3-8</a>; cp <a href="?bref=Acts.23.6">Acts 23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.8">26:8</a>), and (3) the miracle of the new birth (<a href="?bref=John.3.3-8">John 3:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.8-10">Eph 2:8-10</a>).

The fact that God raised Jesus from the dead reveals God’s power over death and gives us a living hope, the promise of eternal life (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3-9">1 Pet 1:3-9</a>). And the person who puts faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord is born anew as a child of God and receives eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">John 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.36">3:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-2">Rom 5:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.11-13">1 Jn 5:11-13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The miraculous activity of Jesus continued in the work of his followers, as demonstrated throughout the book of Acts (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-11">Acts 3:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.12-15">5:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.8">6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.6-7">8:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-42">9:32-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.3">14:3</a>). Filled with the Holy Spirit, the apostles and other Christian leaders performed these miraculous signs, wonders, and mighty works, often in order to offer tangible evidence of the power and truth of the Christian message (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.3">14:3</a>; see <a href="?bref=John.3.2">John 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.4">Heb 2:4</a>).</p>

<title>Visions</title>
<refs>Acts.2.17</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Visions</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Visions are closely related to other revelatory experiences such as dreams (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.5-10">Gen 37:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.40.5-19">40:5-19</a>). Classic examples include Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-14">Ezek 37:1-14</a>) and Isaiah’s vision of God’s throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Isa 6</a>). Visions were often the means by which the Old Testament prophets received messages from the Lord. These visions often contained very striking imagery. The imagery generally offered a graphic, metaphorical depiction of an earthly reality, which was then interpreted for the one seeing the vision by God or an angel.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Visions are also prominent in the book of Acts, and they are usually connected with prayer (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.10-12">Acts 9:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.9">16:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.17-21">22:17-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.11">23:11</a>; see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.8-20">Luke 1:8-20</a>). On one occasion, Cornelius, a Roman officer, was visited by an angel (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-6">Acts 10:1-6</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.30-32">30-32</a>), who told him to send for Peter. The following day, Peter received a vision as he prayed (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.9-16">10:9-16</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.11.5-10">11:5-10</a>) that directly related to his subsequent encounter with Cornelius. In Acts 9, the visions of Paul and Ananias likewise highlight God’s involvement in their lives (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.3-6">9:3-6</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.9.10-16">10-16</a>). These visions are not chance coincidences but the providential outworking of God’s saving purposes in the world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Visions give divine direction and show Christian workers the way in which they should carry out the Great Commission. Paul had visions on the Damascus road at his conversion (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.3-6">Acts 9:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-10">22:6-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.12-19">26:12-19</a>), on the threshold of his missionary advance into Europe (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.9">16:9</a>), at Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.9-11">18:9-11</a>), in the Temple (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.17-21">22:17-21</a>), and again in Jerusalem before he set out on his trip to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.11">23:11</a>). Through visions God is active in guiding the affairs of the church and in extending its mission (see the study notes on <a href="?item=Acts.10.3_StudyNote_Filament">10:3</a>, <a href="?item=Acts.10.9-16_StudyNote_Filament">9-16</a>; <a href="?item=Acts.22.17-22_StudyNote_Filament">22:17-22</a>; <a href="?item=Acts.23.11_StudyNote_Filament">23:11</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gal.1.8-9">Gal 1:8-9</a> and <a href="?item=Gal.1.8-9_StudyNote_Filament">study note there</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Good News Message</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The apostles proclaimed the Good News (or "gospel") message in a definite sequence, with the following elements: (1) The Old Testament promises have been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. (2) God has exalted Jesus by resurrecting him to be the head of the new people of God as the divinely appointed Messiah. (3) The apostles were witnesses of God’s work in Jesus Christ, both as eyewitnesses of his public ministry and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.32">Acts 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.15">3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.33">4:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.30-32">5:30-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.30-31">13:30-31</a>) and as his chosen advocates (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.39-43">10:39-43</a>). (4) The proper response to this Good News is repentance and faith (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.19">3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.39">13:39</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.13.48">48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.30">17:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.21">20:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.20">26:20</a>). (5) The Holy Spirit is promised to those who accept this offer of God’s forgiveness and salvation from sin through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This basic message was repeatedly preached to both Jews and Gentiles throughout the Mediterranean world (see <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.15">9:15</a>), including in the words of Peter and Philip recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.14-41">Acts 2:14-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.12-26">3:12-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.8-12">4:8-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.29-32">5:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.4-13">8:4-13</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.8.26-40">26-40</a>; and <a href="?bref=Acts.10.34-43">10:34-43</a>.

<p class="theme-body">It is through this powerful message of God’s saving grace that people’s hearts and minds are turned toward him. And the reception of this message ushers in salvation.

<title>Circumcision in the New Testament</title>
<refs>Acts.15.1-29</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Circumcision in the New Testament</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Circumcision (cutting off the male foreskin) was widely practiced in the ancient Near East (see <a href="?bref=Jer.9.25-26">Jer 9:25-26</a>). For Jews, it had religious significance as the sign of the covenant that God had established with the people of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">Gen 17:9-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.2">Josh 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.22">John 7:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>; <span class="ital">Sirach</span> 44:20). It was normally performed on the eighth day of a male infant’s life (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.12">Gen 17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.12.3">Lev 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.59">Luke 1:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>). The New Testament notes the circumcision of John the Baptist, Jesus, Paul, and Timothy (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.59">Luke 1:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.21">2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.2-3">Acts 16:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>). Circumcision became a metaphor for the renewal of a person’s relationship with God (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.16">Deut 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.6">30:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.4">Jer 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.28-29">Rom 2:28-29</a>). In the late 40s <span class="era">AD</span>, some Jewish Christians tried to require Gentile Christians to undergo circumcision (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1">Acts 15:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">5</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.21.20-21">21:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.4">Gal 2:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-13">11-13</a>), to which Paul and Barnabas objected (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.2">Acts 15:2</a>). The ensuing church council at Jerusalem settled the matter in favor of not requiring Gentiles to be circumcised (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.19-21">15:19-21</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.28-29">28-29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul insisted that “it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.19">1 Cor 7:19</a>). “What is important is faith expressing itself in love” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>). In Galatians, Paul argued against vigorous Jewish opponents and insisted that everyone enters God’s family simply through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.14-21">Gal 2:14-21</a>). Circumcision is not required for acceptance by God (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Unknown God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When Paul spoke to the Areopagus, the “high council of the city” of Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.19">Acts 17:19</a>), he was speaking to people who did not share his faith in the God of Abraham and Moses who had revealed himself “many times and in many ways to [his] ancestors through the prophets” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1">Heb 1:1</a>). The members of his audience had a very different definition of the divine. A host of divinities inhabited their world, and the common people retained much of their belief in the ancient gods. But many of the cultural elite of Athens no longer believed in the gods in any literal sense. Instead, they held to either a form of materialism (the physical is everything) or pantheism (the divine inhabits everything).</p>
<p class="theme-body">What they all shared in common was the absence of the idea that there is one true God who is Lord of all. Their myths told of the activities of various gods, but they did not have faith that the ultimate reality, God himself, could be known. Instead, they reasoned and discussed “the latest ideas,” hoping for a better understanding of the nature of things.</p>
<p class="theme-body">There were a wide variety of philosophical ideas current in Athens when Paul visited, but two main schools of thought dominated, Stoicism and Epicureanism (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.18">Acts 17:18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Zeno of Citium (334~262 <span class="era">BC</span>) founded Stoicism. Stoics studied nature’s laws and believed in the Logos, a pervasive organizing and sustaining force that gives all things their essential nature and so gives life and reason to humanity. The good life is one in which reason rules, and peace of mind and harmony with nature prevail. Many prominent statesmen were Stoics or influenced by Stoicism, including Cicero, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. Stoic ideas proved attractive to some Christians because of the similarities between the Stoic logos and the divine Logos (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-18">John 1:1-18</a>), and between the idea of natural law and the law of God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Those who followed Epicurus (341–270 <span class="era">BC</span>) were empiricists; they relied upon sense experience (as opposed to reason) for knowledge. Epicureans were concerned with natural evidence and were unenthusiastic about mathematics. Their focus was ethics, the study of right behavior; they judged the value of an action or thing in terms of the pleasure or pain it brought. Epicurus saw belief in gods (meddling and powerful beings who terrified ordinary mortals) as a serious threat to tranquility. For him and his followers, neither the gods nor death (which is the end) should be feared.</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Paul spoke in that context, he used their own poets to proclaim things that they could barely comprehend: That the God who made everything is both personal and knowable; that he revealed himself clearly, historically, and definitively in Jesus Christ; that death is not followed by either the cessation of existence or the migration of the soul, but by judgment; and that the proof of all of this is the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Grace of God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="ital">Grace</span> is a key word in the Bible. It is used to indicate God’s kindness and favor, often in terms of salvation to the undeserving. The New Testament stresses that grace came through Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=John.1.14-17">John 1:14-17</a>). This is not to say that God’s grace was not active in the Old Testament; rather, God’s gracious activity toward humanity reached its culmination through his Son.</p>
<p class="theme-body">According to the book of Acts, God’s great favor was initially experienced in the Jewish community (see <a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-21">Acts 11:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.43-49">13:43-49</a>); later, it became clear that God’s grace in Jesus Christ extends to Gentiles as well (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.8-9">Acts 15:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-18">Eph 2:11-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.11">Titus 2:11</a>). Signs and wonders attested the reality of God’s grace at work among the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.3">Acts 14:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul proclaimed the Good News “about the wonderful grace of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.24">Acts 20:24</a>). Paul never seeks to prove that God is gracious, but he assumes it as a fact when he presents the Good News (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.3.24">Rom 3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.15-21">5:15-21</a>). Paul rules out any idea that we merit our salvation, because God acts solely by his grace (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.4-5">Rom 4:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4-9">Eph 2:4-9</a>). Our good works do not give us right standing with God—if they did, God would be obliged to reward us for our efforts, just as a worker earns a wage (see <a href="?bref=Rom.11.5-6">Rom 11:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s grace continues to impact believers throughout their lives—not just in the moment of conversion. Second Peter closes with a command for Christians to “grow in the grace” of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.18">2 Pet 3:18</a>). Paul encouraged Christians to “continue to rely on the grace of God” as they remained faithful to their Lord (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.43">Acts 13:43</a>). And when Paul left the Ephesian elders, he commended them “to God and the message of his grace,” the divine message that was able to build them up and sustain them (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.32">Acts 20:32</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.15.40">15:40</a>). God’s grace is at the core of the Christian message and the Christian experience, from beginning to end. It is no wonder that the theme of grace is so prevalent in the writings of Jesus’ early followers.</p>

<title>The Gift of Prophecy</title>
<refs>Acts.2.17-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Gift of Prophecy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As Peter had declared at Pentecost, the gift of prophecy was one of the results of the outpouring of God’s Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.17-21">Acts 2:17-21</a>; see <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Joel 2:28-32</a>). The book of Acts names a few Christian prophets (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-28">Acts 11:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.32">15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.9-11">21:9-11</a>; see also <span class="ital">The Martyrdom of Polycarp</span> 12:3; 16:2). One of these prophets was Agabus, whose function was similar to that of an Old Testament prophet, performing symbolic acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.10-11">Acts 21:10-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-32">1 Kgs 11:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.20.2-6">Isa 20:2-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.1-11">Jer 13:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-5.17">Ezek 4:1–5:17</a>) and predicting events to come (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.10-11">21:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Philip the Evangelist was the father of four young women who “had the gift of prophecy” (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.9">21:9</a>). The apostle Paul also acknowledged the prophetic gift of some Christian women (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.5">1 Cor 11:5</a>). In the Old Testament, most prophets were men, but several women are also described as prophets, for example, Miriam (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Exod 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.4">Judg 4:4</a>), and Huldah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.14-20">2 Kgs 22:14-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.22-28">2 Chr 34:22-28</a>). In the New Testament, the gift of prophecy is given to both men and women, and both young and old, as Peter signaled in his sermon at Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.17-18">Acts 2:17-18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although prophecy sometimes involves foretelling the future (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.22-23">20:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.10-11">21:10-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rom.9.24-33">Rom 9:24-33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-17">1 Thes 4:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-4">2 Thes 2:3-4</a>), at its core prophecy is proclaiming God’s word by preaching, exhorting, and explaining the will of God (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.32">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.6">19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6">Rom 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.3-4">1 Cor 14:3-4</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.29-33">29-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.10">Rev 19:10</a>). The gift of prophecy is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Ephesians as one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit and of Christ to the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.4-11">1 Cor 12:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11-13</a>). It is to be used for the benefit of believers (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.22">1 Cor 14:22</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Prophecy is always in need of testing (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.19-21">1 Thes 5:19-21</a>), and the church is strongly warned against false prophets (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1">1 Jn 4:1</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rev.2.20-23">Rev 2:20-23</a>). When used faithfully and in submission to God’s word and his Spirit, courageous proclamation of God’s truth helps the church to determine what God’s will is and inspires God’s people to do it.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Angels</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Throughout the Bible, angels are God’s heavenly agents who carry out his purpose and communicate God’s will to humanity (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.7-12">Gen 16:7-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.22.22-34">Num 22:22-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.13.3-21">Judg 13:3-21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.3">2 Kgs 1:3</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.15">15</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.4-12">Zech 1:4-12</a>). The only angels named in the Bible are Michael and Gabriel, who carry out special assignments (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.16">Dan 8:16</a>, <a href="?bref=Dan.8.18">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.21">9:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.12">10:12</a>, <a href="?bref=Dan.10.21">21</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1-2">12:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.19-20">Luke 1:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.9">Jude 1:9</a>). Angels had a role in putting God’s law into effect through Moses (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.30">Acts 7:30</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.7.35">35</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.7.38">38</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.7.53">53</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.19">Gal 3:19</a>). Angels dispense God’s grace and sometimes administer his judgment (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.35">2 Kgs 19:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.23">Acts 12:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.15">Rev 9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.1-12">16:1-12</a>). Angels were witnesses of Christ’s life (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Tim 3:16</a>), and they are now witnesses of the lives of God’s people (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.10">1 Cor 11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.21">1 Tim 5:21</a>). There are guardian angels who protect God’s people (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.10">Matt 18:10</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.34.7">Pss 34:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.91.11">91:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.11">Acts 12:11</a>). They are “spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.14">Heb 1:14</a>). Angels will accompany Christ when he returns (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31">Matt 25:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7-8">2 Thes 1:7-8</a>) and will participate in the final judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.39">Matt 13:39</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.13.41">41</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.13.49-50">49-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.31">24:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.27">Mark 13:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.26">Luke 9:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.8">12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7">2 Thes 1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Angels appear at some significant points in the Gospels. Angels announced the births of John the Baptist and Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-2.52">Luke 1:1–2:52</a>) and ministered to Jesus after his temptation (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.11">Matt 4:11</a>). Angels also appeared at the empty tomb after the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-8">Matt 28:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.5-7">Mark 16:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.23">Luke 24:23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.12">John 20:12</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The ministry of angels is also prominent in the book of Acts. On multiple occasions, an angel of the Lord made possible miraculous escapes from prison (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.19">5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.6-11">12:6-11</a>). An angel offered a message of encouragement to Paul in the midst of a violent storm (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.23-24">27:23-24</a>). An angel also directed Cornelius to seek the Good News from Peter (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.3">10:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.7">7</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.22">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.13">11:13</a>). Meanwhile, an angel struck down Herod Agrippa “because he accepted the people’s worship instead of giving the glory to God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.23">12:23</a>). Throughout Acts, God was guiding his people in their ministry and using angels to accomplish his purposes.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Some angels have fallen into sin and are destined for eternal judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Matt 25:41</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Pet 2:4</a>, <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.11">11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.6">Jude 1:6</a>). And although angels are spiritual and heavenly beings, angels are not to be worshiped (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.8">Gal 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.18">Col 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.10">Rev 19:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.8-9">22:8-9</a>) because they are inferior to Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.5-14">Heb 1:5-14</a>). Their role is to be servants of God (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.14">Heb 1:14</a>).</p>

God also speaks to all people indirectly in <span class="ital">natural revelation</span> (also called <span class="ital">general revelation</span> because it is given generally, i.e., to everyone), through the world of nature he has created. <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-14">Psalm 19</a>, for example, proclaims that knowledge of God in creation is universal (see <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-4">Ps 19:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Sadly, however, a saving response to God is anything but universal. Paul teaches in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-3.31">Romans 1–3</a> that as a result of Adam’s sin, all people turn away from the knowledge of God that they find in the created world. Apart from God’s grace, natural revelation only condemns people; as Paul states in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.20">1:20</a>, “They have no excuse for not knowing God.”</p>
<p class="theme-body">God can still use natural revelation to awaken people to the reality of himself, the one true God. When accompanied and empowered by the grace of God, the beauty and intricacy of the world can stimulate a search for the Creator. Paul appealed to natural revelation in Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.16-31">Acts 17:16-31</a>) as a bridge to preaching the Good News. God’s revelation in the natural world and in human nature can stimulate people to search for him. And then, through the special revelation he has given in Scripture and in his Son, Jesus Christ, people can come to know him and experience his salvation.</p>

<title>God’s Unified Plan of Salvation</title>
<refs>Rom.3.21-26</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Unified Plan of Salvation</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God’s plan of salvation unfolds throughout Scripture, and the continuity of that plan is a central theme in Romans. In <a href="?bref=Rom.3.21">3:21</a>, Paul makes two important points about the new way of being “made right” with God that has been inaugurated in Jesus Christ. First, it does not depend on obeying the laws and regulations of the Old Testament. Second, it was “promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21">3:21</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.1.2">1:2</a>). God has always planned to save the world through Jesus, and the Old Testament prepared his people for that climactic moment in salvation history. Paul keeps returning to this theme of continuity, especially in chs <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">9–11</a>, where he shows how God’s dealings with Israel fit into that single, unfolding plan.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At the same time, Paul is also concerned to help us understand the discontinuity in God’s single plan of salvation. That plan unfolds in stages. Now that the final stage in Christ has arrived, the prior stage—during which the law of Moses ruled over God’s people—has been left behind. Paul repeatedly emphasizes that our new relationship with God stands separate from the law of Moses (see <a href="?bref=Rom.6.14">6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.7.4-6">7:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.4">10:4</a>). A similar point is made in <a href="?bref=John.1.17">John 1:17</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.10.1">Heb 10:1</a>. Paul’s recurring focus in Romans on the nature of God’s plan helps us to put the whole story of the Bible together in a way that honors all parts of his plan.</p>

<title>The Old Realm and the New</title>
<refs>Rom.5.12-8.39</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Old Realm and the New</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jews in Paul’s day perceived a contrast between the “present evil age” and a “glorious age to come.” Throughout <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-8.39">Romans 5–8</a>, Paul uses these contrasting realms to conceptualize our experience of salvation. The old realm is ruled by death (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">5:12-21</a>), sin (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">6</a>), the law (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.7.1-25">7</a>), and sinful nature (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-11">8:1-11</a>). The new realm is characterized by life (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-21">5</a>), righteous living (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">6</a>), grace (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">6</a>), and the Holy Spirit (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-39">8</a>). People’s destinies are directly impacted by the realm to which they belong.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Each realm is headed by a man who represents its constituents. The old realm of sin and death is headed by Adam, the first man, while the new realm of forgiveness and life is headed by Christ. By nature, all human beings are in the old realm of sin and death and are represented by Adam, the first man—whose sin and death control the destiny of all people (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12">5:12</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.5.18-19">18-19</a>). Those who put their faith in God through Christ are transferred by faith into the new realm of life. God appointed Jesus Christ as a “second Adam” (see <a href="?bref=Rom.5.14">5:14</a>). By obeying God and fulfilling God’s will, Jesus won a decisive victory over the realm of sin that Adam had inaugurated (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.18-19">5:18-19</a>). By receiving God’s gift of grace (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.17">5:17</a>), people accept Jesus as their head and look forward to eternal life.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Those who are in the new realm are identified with Christ and enjoy the benefits of union with him. They have “died with Christ,” they have been “buried with Christ,” and their present new life with Christ is an anticipation of the day when they will “live with him” forever (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.3-11">6:3-11</a>).</p>

<title>The Limitations of Law</title>
<refs>Rom.7.1-25</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Limitations of Law</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The law was central to God’s covenant with the people of Israel, and many Jews in Paul’s day (including Jewish Christians) still saw it as critical to how God’s people lived. Therefore, Paul frequently deals with questions about the law, especially in his letters to the Romans and the Galatians. The pinnacle of his treatment comes in <a href="?bref=Rom.7.1-25">Romans 7</a>, where Paul powerfully argues that the law of Moses, rather than having a positive effect on people’s lives, stimulated sin and brought death (see <a href="?bref=Rom.7.5">7:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul wants his readers to realize that the law is not at fault, however. God’s law is good and holy (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.12">Rom 7:12</a>), but it is powerless to change the human heart. Whether we conclude that Paul (in <a href="?bref=Rom.7.14-25">Romans 7:14-25</a>) is describing the experience of an unbeliever, a mature believer, or an immature believer, the point remains that human sin cannot be overcome by the law. God’s law is given to people who, because of their connection with Adam, are already locked under sin’s power. They may want to do what God tells them, but they find that they cannot. Deliverance can come only through a new and radical experience of God’s power and grace in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.25">Rom 7:25</a>). Through God’s Spirit, Jesus rescues us from “the power of sin that leads to death” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2">Rom 8:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">If God’s good and holy law cannot rescue us from our predicament and save us, how much less helpful are all human laws that people rely on for religious or spiritual well-being. Whether those laws come from a religious figure, a tradition we have inherited, or a church we attend, none of them can change the human soul. They can tell us what to do, but they cannot empower us to do it. God’s law can provide guidelines in the new life God has given us by grace, but it can never substitute for the power of God’s grace, made available through the work of Christ.</p>

<title>The Sovereignty of God</title>
<refs>2Kgs.13.3-5</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Sovereignty of God</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">We human beings always want to think that we are in charge. We think that by our decisions and actions we can determine what will happen. However, Scripture confronts us with quite a different scenario, pointing again and again to the ultimate sovereignty of God (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.4.39">Deut 4:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.5-7">Ps 135:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.8-11">Isa 46:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.24-25">Jude 1:24-25</a>). Although human decisions and actions are significant, the will of God is vastly more important (see <a href="?bref=Jas.4.13-16">Jas 4:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s sovereign hand is in everything. God is in control of the lives of all people (<a href="?bref=Ps.135.5-12">Ps 135:5-12</a>), the universe, and the course of earth’s history (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.15-17">Isa 40:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.24">Acts 17:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Col 1:15-20</a>), directing it to his appointed ends (<a href="?bref=Isa.46.10">Isa 46:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.27-28">Dan 7:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.14-31">Matt 24:14-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.7-8">Rev 1:7-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">As demonstrated throughout 2 Kings, God exercises sovereign power and control over the affairs of nations. He installed and deposed the kings of Israel and Judah according to his purposes and according to the degree of their obedience. He permitted successful attacks against his people as punishment for their sins (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.18-22">2 Kgs 8:18-22</a>). God was in control when the Assyrians attacked Samaria and brought down the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-6">17:1-6</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.18">18</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.20">20</a>). Hezekiah’s successes in Judah were due to the Lord’s blessings (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.5-7">18:5-7</a>). God’s sovereign hand can be seen in all of the complex international events that happened, just as the Lord had promised, during the reigns of the final kings of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26-27">23:26-27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God also displays his power in his answers to the prayers and petitions of his people. When Elisha prayed, God responded to his faithful prophet’s requests. Through Elisha he allowed the woman from Shunem to have a son and later brought that son back to life (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.17">4:17</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.32-35">32-35</a>). The Lord graciously answered the prayers of Jehoahaz and provided a rescuer for beleaguered Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.4-5">13:4-5</a>). He honored Hezekiah’s prayers for Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.1-7">19:1-7</a>) and for his own life (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.1-6">20:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul shows that God determines the course of salvation. Paul constantly explains the unexpected development of salvation history by appealing to what God has said and done. Human decisions alone cannot explain the situation, and God has said that he will show mercy to anyone he chooses (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.15">Rom 9:15</a>). While theologians will continue to debate the role of God’s action and the role of human decision in salvation, God’s sovereignty stands out clearly.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Because God is sovereign, his people rightly seek to live in harmony with his will (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-2">Rom 12:1-2</a>), in the strength that he provides (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.8-9">1 Cor 1:8-9</a>). We can follow the example of Christ in his prayer, “I want your will to be done, not mine” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.39">Matt 26:39</a>). The contemporary world has set God to the side and ignores the divine influence on the course of human affairs. But God’s decisions really do direct the world as well as the personal histories of those who trust him. When we live for God’s glory (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.8">Isa 42:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.2.14">Hab 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.24-25">Jude 1:24-25</a>), whatever happens is also ultimately for our good (<a href="?bref=Ps.84.11">Ps 84:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.16-19">Eph 3:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.11-12">2 Thes 1:11-12</a>), and we can confidently affirm that “God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.28">Rom 8:28</a>)..</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Jews and Gentiles</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">One of the key themes of the New Testament is that God has incorporated Gentiles into the people of God while remaining faithful to his promises to Israel. In <a href="?bref=Rom.11.11-32">Romans 11:11-32</a>, Paul describes God’s plan to save all nations in four distinct stages:</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="bold">1. The Good News is proclaimed to the Jews, who respond (mostly) with unbelief.</span> Using the metaphor of an olive tree, Paul says that “some of these branches from Abraham’s tree . . . have been broken off” (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.17">11:17</a>). This stage was already a matter of history and personal experience for Paul—although he shared the Good News with Jews in synagogues all over the eastern Mediterranean basin, many Jews rejected the message (see <a href="?bref=Acts.13.42-49">Acts 13:42-49</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.4-6">18:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.23-28">28:23-28</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="bold">2. Many Gentiles respond to the message with faith.</span> As the natural branches were broken off, “branches from a wild olive tree have been grafted in” (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.17">Rom 11:17</a>). After being resisted in the synagogues, Paul and the other apostles offered salvation to the Gentiles, and many responded affirmatively (see <a href="?bref=Acts.13.48-49">Acts 13:48-49</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.15-18">26:15-18</a>).

Those who accept God’s offer of salvation—both Jew and Gentile—experience new life (see <a href="?bref=Rom.11.15">11:15</a>) and in the future will experience the resurrection from the dead (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20-26">1 Cor 15:20-26</a>).

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Tolerance</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Paul pleads for tolerance between those who are weak in faith and those who are strong in faith, and he teaches that believers need to accept each other (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.1">Rom 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.7">15:7</a>). He instructs them to stop condemning and belittling each other. Rather, they should learn to worship God with a united voice and spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.6">Rom 15:6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul is addressing the specific issue of whether believers need to practice certain requirements of the Old Testament law and of Jewish worship. Theologians have used the Greek word <span class="greek">adiaphora</span> (“non-essentials”) to describe beliefs or practices that are neither required nor prohibited by Scripture. On such issues, Christians must accommodate a variety of opinions. And sometimes, believers may feel free to participate in certain activities, but to do so would cause problems for others. In such cases, Paul instructs believers to take into account the needs of others before their own (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">1 Cor 8:1-13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul takes a very different approach regarding tolerance when the Good News itself is at stake. In Galatians, for example, Paul confronts false teaching about the Good News by severely castigating the false teachers (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.6-9">Gal 1:6-9</a>) and by warning readers that adopting false teaching will alienate them from Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.4">Gal 5:4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In our day, we need to be careful about what we tolerate and accommodate, and we need to be equally careful about what we decide is worthy of confrontation. Believers need to consider carefully the different issues they confront in their associations with other believers. If the basic truth of the Good News is not violated, we should not quarrel or be divided over such issues. Other issues, however, strike at the heart of the message of Good News. In these cases, Christians need to take a stand and be faithful to the Good News and to Christ. In some cases, it is challenging to discern whether a particular issue is a central, core issue or whether it is a peripheral matter that is important to discuss but not essential for Christian fellowship. The way Paul himself dealt with a variety of issues in his own time can serve as a guide for dealing with conflicts and controversies in our time.</p>

<title>Holiness and Sexual Purity</title>
<refs>1Cor.6.9-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Holiness and Sexual Purity</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Bible emphasizes the importance of being holy in our sexual relations. God created humanity as sexual beings, and the first command that he gave Adam and Eve was to “be fruitful and multiply” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Gen 1:28</a>). But after sin entered the world, the good that God had created—including sex—became prone to distortion, and the pages of Scripture are filled with examples of sexual sin. God’s people were called to holiness, and the Israelites were given numerous commands that connected sexuality to their holiness (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lev 18:1-30</a>). The sexual purity of God’s people would be seriously tested in the land of Canaan where illicit sexual practice abounded. Over and over again, the Israelites would fail to live up to God’s standards for sexual purity.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The believers to whom Paul wrote likewise found themselves living in environments where illicit sexual activity was commonplace. In contrast to the so-called sexual freedom of the Greco-Roman world, the sexual life of God’s people was to be characterized by faithfulness and purity (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.3-8">1 Thes 4:3-8</a>). Sexual relationships are to be restricted to marriage alone (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1-9">1 Cor 7:1-9</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.36-37">36-37</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">God has made Christians holy by the work of his Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.11">1 Cor 6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13">2 Thes 2:13</a>). They are therefore called to live as his own holy people (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>). God has given them everything they need to live a holy life in this world (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.3-4">2 Pet 1:3-4</a>). As a result, their way of life is to be distinctly different from that of the unholy world around them. Every part of their life is to reflect the transforming work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">It is inappropriate for anyone who is united to Christ to have sexual relations with anyone outside of marriage. Such relations violate the Christian’s body, which has become a sanctuary of the living God and therefore belongs to God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-20">1 Cor 6:12-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Though homosexual activity was accepted in Greco-Roman culture, it is condemned throughout the Bible. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, homosexual activity is viewed as a perversion of God’s intentions for men and women (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.22">Lev 18:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.13">20:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.25-27">Rom 1:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.8-11">1 Tim 1:8-11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul strongly warns that those who freely give themselves to illicit sexual relations, whether homosexual or heterosexual, will not inherit the Kingdom of God but will suffer God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-10">1 Cor 6:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-21">Gal 5:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.5-6">Col 3:5-6</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1-3.13">2 Pet 2:1–3:13</a>). As with all sin, though, forgiveness and cleansing are available for those who turn to Christ with faith and repentance (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-26">Rom 3:21-26</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.11">1 Cor 6:11</a>). In every way, God’s people are to live in holiness and godliness (see <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.11-13">2 Pet 3:11-13</a>), in accord with the desires of their Creator and Judge.</p>

<refs>1Cor.6.19-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Belonging to Christ</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">To many modern readers, the New Testament seems to portray an extreme view of the Christian life. Believers are called to forfeit their rights, suffer, and even die for the sake of Christ (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.34-36">Mark 8:34-36</a>). They are to turn away from the things of the world that everybody else lives for (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.15-17">1 Jn 2:15-17</a>) and even to despise their life in this world (<a href="?bref=John.12.24-25">John 12:24-25</a>). Paul encourages believers to give up the normal desires for marriage and family and remain single for Christ, if they have that spiritual gift (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.7">1 Cor 7:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">What lies behind such an apparently extreme view of life? For Paul, it is the awareness that believers are claimed by Christ and so belong to him, body and soul. When Christ died, he bought them for himself (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.20">6:20</a>). They must no longer live simply for themselves and their own desires (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14-15">2 Cor 5:14-15</a>). Having died to their own personal interests, they are called to live entirely for their Lord (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.7-9">Rom 14:7-9</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">For true Christians, obedience to Christ is not an onerous burden, but a way to express their love and loyalty to the one who died for them. For the people of Christ, the whole of life is to be a joyful expression of thanks for the grace God has shown them in Jesus Christ. They gladly yield their lives to serve the one who gave up everything for them (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.16">1 Jn 3:16</a>). By dying to themselves, believers make it possible for Christ to live in and through them (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.19-20">Gal 2:19-20</a>).</p>

<title>Giving up Rights</title>
<refs>1Cor.8.1-9.23</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Giving Up Rights</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Paul nowhere tells believers that they should defend their rights. On the contrary, he emphasizes that believers must always be willing to give up their rights for the sake of others. Believers are free from many of the rules that others feel bound by, but they must always be ready to give up their freedoms if their actions would cause someone else to sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.13-23">Rom 14:13-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">1 Cor 8:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.23-33">10:23-33</a>). Defending one’s own personal rights is of little value to Paul.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul, like Jesus, sees loving others as one of the most important principles in life (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">1 Cor 13:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>; see <a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-44">Matt 5:43-44</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.36-39">22:36-39</a>). Real Christian love is always sacrificial (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.4-7">1 Cor 13:4-7</a>), like Christ’s own love. Believers ought never to focus on what is best for themselves, but on what is best for others (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.32-33">1 Cor 10:32-33</a>). The sacrificial death of Christ for sinners is the model that reveals the nature of true love (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.6-8">Rom 5:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.1-5">15:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.9-12">1 Jn 4:9-12</a>). The whole of a believer’s life is to be an expression of Christ’s sacrificial love. This will never be easy, for it means people must consider themselves dead to their own desires (see <a href="?bref=Mark.8.34-35">Mark 8:34-35</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Holy Spirit’s Work</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Different New Testament writers emphasized different aspects of the Holy Spirit’s work. John, for example, highlighted the Spirit’s role as teacher and revealer of God’s thoughts and ways (<a href="?bref=John.14.17">John 14:17</a>, <a href="?bref=John.14.26">26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.13-15">16:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.20">1 Jn 2:20</a>, <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.27">27</a>).

<p class="theme-body">According to Paul, God gives his Holy Spirit to all who come into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">1 Cor 6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.2-5">Gal 3:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13-14">Eph 1:13-14</a>).

He affirms believers’ salvation (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.11">1 Cor 6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13">2 Thes 2:13</a>) and their identity as children of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9">Rom 8:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.8.14-17">14-17</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Holy Spirit gives Christians power over sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-4">Rom 8:1-4</a>), power to live a fruitful life (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Gal 5:22-23</a>), and power for ministry (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-31">1 Cor 12:1-31</a>). Believers are to be continuously “filled with the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.18">Eph 5:18</a>), and though they experience the conflict between the flesh and the Spirit, they can please God by yielding to the Spirit’s guidance and power (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.16-18">Gal 5:16-18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Holy Spirit enables Christians to understand God’s thoughts and ways (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.9-16">1 Cor 2:9-16</a>). He gives spiritual gifts to believers to help the church grow (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-31">12:1-31</a>).

<p class="theme-title">The Church as a Dynamic Body</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Paul viewed the church as the living body of Christ comprised of believers. Paul made no formal distinction between professional clergy and laity, in which the ministry was done only by the clergy. The community had leaders (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.1-13">1 Tim 3:1-13</a>), but every believer had a ministry in building up the body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-31">1 Cor 12:12-31</a>). When the early believers gathered together, usually in someone’s home, everyone brought something from God to share with the others (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26-33">14:26-33</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul understood God’s Spirit as gifting people for their specific ministries (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.7-11">12:7-11</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28">28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6-8">Rom 12:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>) and leading them when they came together for worship. Guided by the Spirit, every believer was to use their spiritual gifts for the benefit of the church. Paul wanted believers to be sensitive to the empowering of the Spirit in all that they did (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26-33">1 Cor 14:26-33</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When believers meet together, every individual is important and each one has an active role to play. Believers must listen for God speaking his word—and be prepared to speak it—in all their relationships. Paul also calls for the others to “evaluate” what is said (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26">14:26</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.29">29</a>). Every believer is a crucial part of the body, called to be actively involved in its growth.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Loving Others</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus spoke of loving one’s neighbor as the second most important of the Old Testament commandments (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.31">Mark 12:31</a>). In fact, love summarizes the entire Old Testament law (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.40">22:40</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.7.12">Matt 7:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-13">9:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-13">12:1-13</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>). Jesus criticized the Pharisees for their failure to show love (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.13">Matt 9:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.7">12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.4">23:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.23.13-14">13-14</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">23</a>). Love is the mark of a true follower of Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.13.34-35">John 13:34-35</a>) and of an authentic experience of God (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.9-11">1 Jn 2:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.11-18">3:11-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.7-21">4:7-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">For Paul, love is more important than any of the spiritual gifts and the most important virtue. Love “binds us all together in perfect harmony” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.14">Col 3:14</a>). Without love, ministry has limited value (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-3">1 Cor 13:1-3</a>). Paul summed up the whole of Christian ethics as “faith expressing itself in love” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>). Love is the natural outworking of Christian faith, the primary fruit of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>), and the most important motivation for ministry. As believers grow in Christ, they will seek more and more to love others as he did.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Resurrection of the Dead</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus spoke of a future resurrection of all people—either to eternal life or to judgment (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.26-27">Mark 12:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.28-29">John 5:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.39-40">6:39-40</a>, <a href="?bref=John.6.44">44</a>, <a href="?bref=John.6.54">54</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.25-26">11:25-26</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.20.34-36">Luke 20:34-36</a>). When Christ returns, all his people will be resurrected to be with him forever (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-18">1 Thes 4:13-18</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-10">2 Cor 5:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">This strong hope characterized the outlook of the early Christians. They were able to endure their suffering because their eyes were fixed on what lay beyond this life (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16-18">2 Cor 4:16-18</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Heb.12.2">Heb 12:2</a>). They expected Jesus to return and resurrect their bodies, and they looked forward to living with him forever (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3-6">1 Pet 1:3-6</a>, <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.23">23</a>). Their faith was based on the foundation of Jesus’ own bodily resurrection (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-20">1 Cor 15:12-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.33">Acts 4:33</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.14">2 Cor 4:14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Resurrection bodies will be fundamentally different from the bodies we experience in this life, with all of their limitations and failings. These renewed bodies will be glorious, strong, immortal, and spiritual, like Christ’s own resurrection body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-58">1 Cor 15:35-58</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Because they are already joined to Christ, believers actually begin to experience resurrection existence here and now. They have already been “raised” with Christ; they have already been given “resurrection life” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.4-11">Rom 6:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.10-11">8:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.12">Col 2:12</a>). As a result, their lives are now centered in the spiritual realities of heaven rather than in worldly things (<a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">Col 3:1-4</a>). Believers can experience the transforming power of that new life here and now, the new life of the Spirit that frees them from the power of sin and death (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-4">Rom 8:1-4</a>). In all the difficulties they face, their trust is not in themselves but in the resurrection power of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.9">2 Cor 1:9</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">God’s New Covenant</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God had promised to establish a new covenant with his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>). This new covenant was initiated by Christ (see <a href="?bref=Luke.22.19-20">Luke 22:19-20</a>), who removes the veil associated with the old covenant (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.14">2 Cor 3:14</a>). Using the creation story of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-2.25">Genesis 1–2</a>, Paul explains how the God of creation is also the God of the new creation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4-6">2 Cor 4:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">5:17</a>). God is now revealed in Christ, who brings God close to us.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the new covenant, God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is also our Father because he has enabled us to be adopted as his children (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.3">2 Cor 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.26-4.7">Gal 3:26–4:7</a>). He is the faithful God whose Old Testament promises are fulfilled in the Messiah (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.18-22">2 Cor 1:18-22</a>). And he is the author of reconciliation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.18-21">5:18-21</a>), as Christ became the means by which God won the sinful world back to himself. Jesus Christ became one with sinful humankind (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.9">8:9</a>) and released God’s saving power and righteousness to restore the broken relationship between God and the world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Under the new covenant, God sends his Spirit to dwell among his people. The Spirit gives believers life, freedom, and the ability to conform to Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">3:6</a>, <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17-18">17-18</a>).

Paul gives a full account of this hope in <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-10">2 Cor 5:1-10</a>. This will be the final outcome of the new covenant that God has established for his people.</p>

<title>The Message of Reconciliation</title>
<refs>2Cor.5.18-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Message of Reconciliation</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="ital">Reconciliation</span> is a term found throughout the New Testament. In <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-11">Romans 5:1-11</a>, Paul concentrates on the cost of God’s reconciling work in the death of his son. <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Colossians 1:15-20</a> is a hymn in praise of the cosmic scope of reconciliation, focused on the exalted Lord who is ruler of all. In <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-22">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>, the emphasis is on the reconciliation that embraces both Jews and Gentiles to form a united church with all hostility broken down.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul’s fullest exposition of reconciliation comes in a discussion of the meaning of Jesus’ death in <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.18-21">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>. Earlier, Paul had reminded the Corinthians of the centrality of the cross (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3-5">1 Cor 15:3-5</a>) but had not elaborated much at that point on the meaning of that saving event. Now he explains what Christ’s death on the cross means: Christ identified himself with human sin so that sinners might be restored to their family relationship with God. This reconciliation turns enemies into friends. The cost of this exchange is that “God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">With the resurrection of Jesus and his triumph over death, a new world is born—a new era in which God’s people have the promise of eternal fellowship with him (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.14-5.10">2 Cor 4:14–5:10</a>). Those who have trusted in Christ for salvation have received the gift of the Holy Spirit, the guarantee of future salvation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.5">5:5</a>). They know that God has accepted them and will welcome them forever.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Those who have been reconciled to God are called to participate in the ministry of reconciliation, helping people find their way back to God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.18-21">2 Cor 5:18-21</a>). And because believers have experienced this reconciliation, they are to pursue opportunities for reconciliation in their interpersonal relationships as well (see <a href="?bref=Matt.5.24">Matt 5:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.15">18:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.18">Rom 12:18</a>).</p>

Yet the prophets of Israel looked forward to a new temple; they announced a message of hope that God would once again live among his people (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.56.7">Isa 56:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-43.27">Ezek 40–43</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">While the Temple in Jerusalem was rebuilt after the Exile—and reached a pinnacle during the renovations of Herod the Great—the hopes of God’s people were ultimately fulfilled in the coming of Jesus (see <a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.19-22">2:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.21-24">4:21-24</a>). He himself is God’s temple, the place where God’s holiness resides, and he calls his people to join him. Thus, God’s people are to be a holy temple of God, a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16">2 Cor 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.21">Eph 2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pet 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">Rev 3:12</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul called on believers to realize their identity as God’s “holy people” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1">2 Cor 1:1</a>) in two ways: They were to separate themselves from moral evil, and they were to be dedicated to God in holy living and service. Christians are therefore urged, “Let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit. And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.1">2 Cor 7:1</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Christian Giving</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Bountiful giving is a mark of true grace. We see its sublime expression in the Lord of glory, who by his poverty became one with us and made us rich (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.9">2 Cor 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-8">Phil 2:5-8</a>). We have received his unmerited favor in salvation, and we give sacrificially in response to “this gift too wonderful for words!” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.15">9:15</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Jesus taught that generosity would be one evidence of those who follow him (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.34-36">Matt 25:34-36</a>), and he stressed the importance of a person’s intentions and attitude, not simply the amount given (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.41-44">Mark 12:41-44</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul dedicates a lot of his attention in 2 Corinthians to the theme of giving. The church at Corinth was encouraged to give generously in response to human need, specifically the needs of the poor Jewish Christians in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.6-7">2 Cor 8:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.1-5">9:1-5</a>). It would be a sign that the Gentile Christians were one body with the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul’s teaching on Christian giving in can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="theme-body">(1) Our giving should spring from a willing mind and heart (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.12">2 Cor 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.7">9:7</a>). Paul emphasizes motives because all giving should hinge on why we give.</p>
<p class="theme-body">(2) True giving is a joy, in contrast with grudging gifts (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.5">9:5</a>). There is joy in sowing seed, like a farmer who anticipates a crop (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.6-10">9:6-10</a>); and there is joy in sharing with others in need (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.1-2">9:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">(3) Christian giving is marked by generosity and may entail sacrifice, as it did for the Macedonians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-5">8:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">(4) The handling of financial gifts calls for honesty, integrity, and care. Paul was careful to deflect any suspicion of his colleagues who were sent to collect gifts from the churches (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.20-21">8:20-21</a>). Those who handle monetary gifts in the church should be persons of proven reputation and responsibility.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Christian living is to be marked by a generous concern for those in need, and Paul instructs believers to please God, not themselves (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.15">5:15</a>). Believers are called to live under Christ’s lordship and be motivated by his love (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14">5:14</a>). We can demonstrate his love tangibly in our giving.</p>

<title>Paul’s Apostolic Service</title>
<refs>2Cor.10.1-13.10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Paul’s Apostolic Service</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">To understand Paul’s role as an apostle of Jesus Christ, there is perhaps no better place to look than Paul’s own description in 2 Corinthians. In this letter, Paul reveals the heart of his ministry. Paul was God’s special messenger for the establishment and nurture of churches in the Gentile world. His service was marked by seriousness and sincerity, and his message raised life and death issues (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.15-17">2 Cor 2:15-17</a>). As a pioneer missionary, he took the Good News to places where Christ’s name was not yet known (see <a href="?bref=Rom.15.20-21">Rom 15:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul’s message of Good News was clear and incisive (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-21">2 Cor 5:1-21</a>), and it was backed up and illustrated by his own life. He always sought to minister with truth and integrity (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.17">2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.2">4:2</a>). And as Paul carried the message of Christ, the cross served as the pattern for his ministry to others (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.16-33">11:16-33</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul’s authority was apparently disputed, so he needed to offer a personal account of how God had called him as an apostle and established his ministry at Corinth (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.12-18">10:12-18</a>). For those who demanded proof of Paul’s credentials (<a href="?bref=2Cor.13.3">13:3</a>) and who criticized his weaknesses, he simply pointed to the cross of Jesus (<a href="?bref=2Cor.13.4">13:4</a>) and to the lessons he had learned from it (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.10">4:10</a>). Paul was quite conscious of his own limitations and that he needed divine grace to accomplish his work. But true apostolic authority expresses itself precisely in human weakness reinforced by divine strength (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.1-10">12:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul also performed miraculous works to verify his claim to apostleship (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.12">12:12</a>). These works apparently were not enough to prevent doubts from arising in the young church at Corinth. Yet Paul exercised his ministry with great patience, not giving up when the Corinthians challenged him. This patience replicates that of Jesus, who endured much hositility from others (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.2-3">Heb 12:2-3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul’s example provides a few lessons for all those who are involved in Christian service: (1) Christian leaders should take criticism as a summons to self-examination, to see if any accusation is well-founded. (2) Christian leaders should be patient in the face of groundless opposition, staying focused on the task at hand. (3) There is a place for reasoned defense and explanation of one’s motives, while at the same time recognizing that the Lord is the ultimate Judge.</p>

<refs>Gal.2.1-5.12</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Righteousness by Faith</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">A key issue that emerged in the first-century church was whether or not Gentiles who received the Good News had to follow Jewish regulations—including circumcision—in order to be able to join the family of God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For Paul, the answer was simple: There is nothing people can or need to do. Only Christ could do—and has done—what must be done to make people right with God. Our response is simply to receive his gift, gratefully thank him for what he has done for us, and trust in him.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For Jewish Christians in the first century, it was hard to accept this answer. From the time of Abraham, right relationship with God had been marked by circumcision, the rite of cutting off the male foreskin (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">Gen 17:9-14</a>). Every male who was part of God’s family had to be circumcised, and those who neglected to do so were cut off from God’s people. Those who had received circumcision were also expected to keep the rest of the law, including the Sabbath and dietary regulations.</p>
<p class="theme-body">When the Christian faith moved from the Jewish to the Gentile world, it was natural for questions to arise. Do Christians need to be circumcised—and keep God’s law in general—to be accepted as part of God’s family? Or does God accept people purely on the basis of their faith in Christ’s work on the cross? As Paul’s mission to Gentiles advanced, these questions became pressing.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The apostle Peter understood from his vision in Joppa and his experience in Caesarea that God has accepted Gentiles <span class="ital">as Gentiles,</span> on the basis of their faith in Christ’s finished work (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.9-11.18">Acts 10:9–11:18</a>). They did not have to become Jewish by observing circumcision, for Christ provided them open access to God by faith. Peter and the Jerusalem church therefore welcomed Gentile believers into fellowship. But later, Peter temporarily withdrew from fellowship with Gentiles when some Jewish Christians criticized him (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-13">Gal 2:11-13</a>). In response, Paul rebuked Peter for communicating that Gentiles must become Jews in order to be accepted by God (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.14-21">2:14-21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">No one is accepted by God and made righteous before him on the basis of keeping the law (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.16">2:16</a>). Even Abraham himself was counted as righteous because of his faith (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gen 15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6">Gal 3:6</a>)—not because he was circumcised, which came later (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">Gen 17:9-14</a>). Both Jews and Gentiles are made righteous before God on the basis of faith alone.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Law and the Spirit</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">An enduring question of the Christian faith is, Do Christians need to keep the Old Testament law in order to become mature followers of Christ? Does following God’s law provide sanctification?</p>
<p class="theme-body">When the Christians in Galatia had received the Good News of salvation through faith in Christ, they had also received the Holy Spirit as the guarantee of their status as believers. Not only had God given his Spirit to them, but he had also worked miracles among them (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.5">Gal 3:5</a>). They knew from experience that the Holy Spirit has the power to make them new people, and Paul had taught them to rely on the Spirit to guide them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Shortly after Paul left Galatia, Jewish-Christian teachers arrived who taught the need to observe God’s law, both to be accepted by God and to be sanctified and become mature. They argued that Paul’s approach to sanctification by the Spirit would lead to lawlessness and sin.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul responded that, just as God <span class="ital">counts</span> us as righteous by faith, so also he <span class="ital">makes</span> us righteous by faith, through the working of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.16-26">Gal 5:16-26</a>). Those who rely on the Spirit and follow his leading will not sin—God’s Spirit will never lead people to sin.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The real problem is not a lack of understanding regarding right and wrong. Our God-given conscience tells us when we’re doing wrong, and God’s law makes the requirements of his righteousness even clearer (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.7-12">Rom 7:7-12</a>). The real problem is that, by nature, our hearts are hard and sinful, and we lack the wisdom to know the right thing to do in a given situation. By nature, we are unable to apply God’s word in a way that is consistent with his intentions.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The law cannot ameliorate our condition. But when the Holy Spirit guides and controls us, he changes our hearts to do the things that please God (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Gal 5:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.5-14">Rom 8:5-14</a>). God’s Spirit guides his people to fulfill his law in its true sense and intent. But fulfillment of the law must not be the goal or focus—the law is just our guardian (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.24-25">Gal 3:24-25</a>). Instead, we focus on trusting God, relying on the Spirit, and loving others. God’s Spirit gives us the will and the power to do these things in a way that pleases God.</p>

<p class="theme-body-fl">The church is the community of those who recognize the lordship of Christ and submit to him (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.21-24">Eph 5:21-24</a>). In the Greek world, the word translated “church” (Greek <span class="greek">ekklēsia</span>) designated an “assembly” of people such as a regularly summoned political body or simply an informal gathering (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.19.32">Acts 19:32</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.19.39">39</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.19.41">41</a>). Similarly, in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) the term is used to refer to the assembly of Israel (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.31.30">Deut 31:30</a>). In the New Testament, <span class="greek">ekklēsia</span> is used to refer to (a) the entire body of Christ in the world (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matt 16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.22">Eph 1:22</a>); (b) all the believers in a given locale (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.9.31">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>); or (c) an individual local congregation that gathers regularly for worship, instruction, fellowship, and prayer (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.16.5">Rom 16:5</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.42">Acts 2:42</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-body-sp">The church is part of God’s plan to bring everything in heaven and on earth under the authority of Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.9-10">Eph 1:9-10</a>). Through Jesus Christ, God has called people from both Judaism and the Gentile world to be one new people of God (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.16">Gal 6:16</a>), empowered by his Spirit to be present in the world, to worship him, and to share the Good News of his unconditional love (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-22">Eph 2:11-22</a>). The church is both grounded in Judaism and is the fulfillment of God’s intention in calling Israel to become “a light to the Gentiles” who “will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">Isa 49:6</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rom.11.1-5">Rom 11:1-5</a>). In this new Jewish-Gentile community, the traditional barriers that divided people from one another and categorized them into inferior and superior classes—barriers of race, social standing, and sex—are shattered (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Gal 3:28</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Those who are united with Christ are members of his body. Paul expresses the reality of the intimate connection between Christ and his people in terms of the organic unity and integration of the physical body (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.4-8">Rom 12:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-27">1 Cor 12:12-27</a>). To be “in Christ” is therefore to be “baptized into one body by one Spirit” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-13">1 Cor 12:12-13</a>). As a result, “All of you together are Christ’s body, and each of you is a part of it” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27">1 Cor 12:27</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Believers do not relate to God in isolation but as part of this new family. To be “in Christ” is at the same time to be in the church. To be a Christian is to be incorporated into a community of people that is growing toward expressing the reality of Christ in its life together.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Because the church is one body, unity is called for. So Paul repeatedly urged the Christian community to be united and not to let their differences divide them from one another.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Because the church comprises people of different ethnic groups, it is to be a community of harmony and peace as believers live together in love, bound together by the shared experience of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.2-6">Eph 4:2-6</a>). God’s goal for the church is that it will achieve the fullest possible experience of unity, faith, spiritual understanding, and Christian maturity—to the full perfection of Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.13">4:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Eph.4.15">15</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>), the likeness of God himself (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">Eph 4:24</a>, <a href="?bref=Eph.4.32">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.1">5:1</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Like every part of a human body, every member of the church has his or her function. God has provided people in the church with many diverse gifts to build up the body and bring it to its full purpose (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.11-16">4:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6-8">Rom 12:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.7-11">1 Cor 12:7-11</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28">28</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Old Life and the New Life</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When people become believers in Christ, they are joined to him and begin to share in his death and resurrection. Their old life, marred by sin, dies with Christ, and they begin a new life by his power within them (see <a href="?bref=Rom.6.3-14">Rom 6:3-14</a>). This is the work of God, who transforms them by his Spirit. Their minds are renewed (see <a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>), their desires and actions change, and their lives begin to reflect his Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Gal 5:22-23</a>). They gradually grow into the likeness of Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Believers also have a responsibility to live out Christ’s death and resurrection (see <a href="?bref=Phil.3.10-11">Phil 3:10-14</a>). They are to turn away from darkness and embrace a life full of light (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.17-5.20">Eph 4:17–5:20</a>). Paul speaks of this transformation by using the imagery of clothing. Believers are called to take off the old, sinful life driven by the devil and put on a new, pure life directed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.21-24">Eph 4:21-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-15">Col 3:1-15</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gal.3.27">Gal 3:27</a>). As they do so, they recognize their reliance on God’s grace and power.</p>

<title>Overcoming the Devil</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Overcoming the Devil</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The New Testament writers were convinced of the reality of evil and the dangers of the spiritual world. So they took Satan (the evil one, the devil) seriously as a real threat. The devil inhibits the work of God’s people (see <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.18">1 Thes 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">Rev 2:10</a>), and he “prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8">1 Pet 5:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The entire unbelieving world is subject to the power of sin and the devil (see <a href="?bref=Eph.2.2">Eph 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.19">1 Jn 5:19</a>). As the “god of this world,” the devil can blind the minds of unbelievers (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4">2 Cor 4:4</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.13.19">Matt 13:19</a>). While Satan opposes God and seeks to destroy his people (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.12">Rev 12:12</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.12.17">17</a>), Jesus came to destroy Satan’s work (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.8">1 Jn 3:8</a>). God turns what the devil intends for evil into good. Following this principle, Paul instructs the church at Corinth to expel someone from Christian fellowship in order that, by being exposed to the devil’s destructive power, that person might repent and be saved (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Christians are to stand firm and resist the devil (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.7">Jas 4:7</a>), praying for God’s deliverance (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.13">Matt 6:13</a>) and availing themselves of the armor that God provides for their defense (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.10-20">Eph 6:10-20</a>). Those who yield to Satan’s influence suffer the consequences (see <a href="?bref=Acts.5.1-5">Acts 5:1-5</a>). But believers who walk with Christ are secure because they know that the cross has broken the devil’s power (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.38-39">Rom 8:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.24">1 Cor 15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.13">Col 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.10">2:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Col.2.15">15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.22">1 Pet 3:22</a>) and that the Lord protects them (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.18">1 Jn 5:18</a>). They also know that the Holy Spirit within them is greater than the devil (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.4">1 Jn 4:4</a>). By the word of God, they can overcome the evil one (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.14">1 Jn 2:14</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rev.12.11">Rev 12:11</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although believers need to be wary of the devil and protect themselves from his power, they need not live in fear. The power of the devil is no match for the power of God. And in the end, the devil will be ultimately and totally defeated (see <a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-10">Rev 20:7-10</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Christ Hymn: Christ’s Divine Nature</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Philippians 2:6-11</a>, often called the Christ Hymn, reveals early Christian beliefs about the nature of Jesus Christ. This hymn affirms that the early Christians believed in the preexistence and divine nature of Christ (see also <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Col 1:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">2:9</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=John.1.1-2">John 1:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-3">Heb 1:1-3</a>). Christ is not simply another human prophet. He was present with God the Father from the very beginning, and he is the one through whom the universe was created. As the Son of God, he shares the nature of God himself. This claim was a major point of contention between Jesus and the religous leaders, who accused Jesus of blasphemy (<a href="?bref=John.5.16-18">John 5:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.54-59">8:54-59</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.30-39">10:30-39</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The hymn also affirms that Jesus Christ came to earth in an act of immense humility—the infinite God became human (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.7">Phil 2:7</a>; see <a href="?bref=Col.1.15">Col 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.10-14">John 1:10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.14">Heb 2:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">17</a>).

<p class="theme-body">This hymn also affirms that God raised Jesus from the dead, has given him “the place of highest honor” in heaven (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.9">Phil 2:9</a>), and conferred on him the title “Lord” (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.11">2:11</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>). One day, all created beings will bow before him and acknowledge that he is Lord of the entire universe (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>), deserving of the worship that God alone is worthy to receive (see <a href="?bref=Rev.5.8-14">Rev 5:8-14</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Christian Joy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the last hours of his life, Jesus expressed a desire that his disciples “be filled with [his] joy” (see <a href="?bref=John.15.11">John 15:11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.20-24">16:20-24</a>). The subject of joy emerges in a number of Paul’s letters and is a major theme in Philippians. Often when Paul encourages believers to be filled with joy, his words are directed toward those who are experiencing persecution—for example, believers in Philippi and Thessalonica (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.1">Phil 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.4">4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.16">1 Thes 5:16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Superficial happiness is dependent on circumstances. Christian joy is clearly different; it is rooted in a person’s relationship with the Lord, and it is resilient even in the midst of suffering and death. Joy comes in knowing that whatever happens, God will use everything for our ultimate good (see <a href="?bref=Rom.5.3-4">Rom 5:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.28">8:28</a>). Believers also have joy from the dynamic presence of God’s Spirit in their hearts (see <a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>). The real secret to a joyful life is in continuously being “filled with the Holy Spirit” (see <a href="?bref=Eph.5.18">Eph 5:18</a>). The attitudes of believers are not defined by outward circumstances, but by a relationship with the living God.</p>

Frequently, as in <a href="?bref=Col.1.26">Col 1:26</a>, Paul claims that the secret had been hidden in the past but has now been revealed (see also <a href="?bref=Rom.16.25">Rom 16:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.7">1 Cor 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.9">Eph 3:9</a>). Paul does not mean by this that the Good News is a secret that has to be probed or that it is some kind of Gnostic idea only a few can discover. Rather, he adapts the term from Jewish apocalyptic teaching (the term <span class="ital">apocalyptic</span> is from a Greek word that means “uncovering” or “revelation”; the same word supplies the name for the book of Revelation). In the apocalyptic perspective, the plan God has mapped out for all of history already exists in his mind but is hidden from human eyes until God chooses to disclose it. For Paul, the secret plan has now been disclosed in Christ, and it is broadcast throughout the world by his apostles.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Through the Old Testament prophets, God foretold many elements of the Good News, but he kept some aspects of it hidden until he revealed them in the New Testament era. These include the full participation of Gentiles as fellow-heirs with Jews (<a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.1-9">Eph 3:1-9</a>); the indwelling of Christ in believers (<a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.2">2:2</a>); and the union of Christ and the church, as illustrated by the union of husband and wife (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.32">Eph 5:32</a>). Some elements of God’s plan are still hidden and await further revelation, such as the salvation of all Israel (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.25-27">Rom 11:25-27</a>) and the transfiguration of Christians at the time of Christ’s return (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.51-53">1 Cor 15:51-53</a>).</p>

<title>Legalism</title>
<refs>Col.2.16-23</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Legalism</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The law was of critical importance for the Jewish people, and their understanding of religion was largely centered on the observance of rules and rituals. This was natural to them because God had given his law to the Jewish people as a mark of his favor upon them and as a way for them to ratify the covenant agreement he had made with them. However, many Jews added to the laws that God had given his people, trying to develop rules for virtually every situation in which they might find themselves. Their motivation was often a positive desire not to transgress any of God’s laws. As Jesus often pointed out, however, the rules developed by religious leaders sometimes became obstacles to obeying God’s instructions (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-15">Mark 7:1-15</a>). Furthermore, many Jews thought that following the law would automatically endear them to God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul frequently confronted this kind of problematic legalism in the early churches. For example, in Colosse, false teachers, influenced by Jewish beliefs, were insisting that Christians follow certain rules as a way of expressing their faith (<a href="?bref=Col.2.16-23">Colossians 2:16-23</a>). Paul criticized this in light of faith in Christ. As the culmination of all God’s plans and purposes, Christ is the center of all true piety.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This does not mean that rules for conduct are inherently bad. Some rules, such as the prohibition on lying (<a href="?bref=Col.3.9">Col 3:9</a>), clearly manifest an aspect of Christ’s character. Paul also had no problem with individual Christians imposing rules on themselves that they think are conducive to their own growth in Christ (cp. <a href="?bref=Rom.14.5">Rom 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">1 Cor 8</a>). But they must not require others to obey these self-imposed rules.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Last Things and the Thessalonians</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Thessalonian believers heartily embraced Paul’s teaching about the day of the Lord and Christ’s second coming, but this instruction generated questions and speculations about the end times. What would happen to believers who died before Jesus’ return (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-18">1 Thes 4:13-18</a>)? When would the day of the Lord come (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-11">5:1-11</a>)? Would believers suffer the wrath of God (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.10">1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.9">5:9</a>)? Paul calms the congregation by clarifying these topics (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-5.11">4:13–5:11</a>) and reminding them of the teaching they had already received.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Although Paul expected Jesus’ return to happen during his lifetime (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15">4:15</a>), he also recognized that the final event would come at an unpredictable moment, “like a thief in the night” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.2">5:2</a>). The way to be ready for the end is not by knowing the date but by living with Christian alertness, a constant spiritual watchfulness and readiness to meet Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Thessalonians also needed to understand the deaths of fellow believers. Paul says nothing about the condition of believers between their death and the return of Christ. Instead, he emphasizes the resurrection. Just as Christ was raised, those who die as believers will be raised when he returns. In fact, they will rise from the dead first and then be caught up together with the living believers to meet Christ in his royal coming.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Despite Paul’s efforts to clarify the Christian hope, the Thessalonian believers became confused by false teaching that the day of the Lord had already begun (see <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.2">2 Thes 2:2</a>). As a counterpoint to this false teaching, Paul further addressed this topic in his second letter to the young church (see <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-12">2 Thes 2:1-12</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">“He Will Come”</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Jesus promised his followers that he would return so that he could bring them to be with him forever (<a href="?bref=John.14.1-3">John 14:1-3</a>). Immediately after Jesus ascended to heaven, the apostles received a message that he would someday come back (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.9-11">Acts 1:9-11</a>). And in the visions that are recounted in the book of Revelation, John again hears from Jesus the promise of his return (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.6-20">22:6-20</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">This final consummation of all things—the “day of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.2">2:2</a>)—will come when least expected, like “a thief in the night” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.2">1 Thes 5:2</a>). Only the Father knows when that day will be (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.36">Matt 24:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-7">Acts 1:6-7</a>). The present is not a time for speculation but for hope and confidence. Setting dates and times is not the way Christians should approach questions about the end. Scripture teaches about final things (<span class="ital">eschatology</span>) to give hope in the midst of trouble and perspective on present life and conduct. Hence, though Paul lays out certain events that will precede the day of the Lord, such as apostasy and the appearance of the man of lawlessness (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-12">2 Thes 2:1-12</a>), the details are not the focus of his attention. Rather, he reminds his audience of these events (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.5">2 Thes 2:5</a>) in order to refute false teaching and to encourage believers who are facing persecution (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.3-10">2 Thes 1:3-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">When Christ comes, he will destroy the enemies of the Good News, rescue persecuted believers (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7-10">2 Thes 1:7-10</a>), and gather his followers to be with him for eternity (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-17">1 Thes 4:13-17</a>). This future event calls for a present response. Those who receive the Good News and live for God can have confidence of rescue. Those who reject God will experience everlasting destruction. God’s choosing and calling of believers is their hope and comfort (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13-14">2:13-14</a>). They can stand firm in the present as they face the future (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.14-15">2:14-15</a>), knowing what will be the outcome when he comes.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Work and Patronage</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When Paul first visited Thessalonica, he taught the believers to work for a living rather than being unnecessarily dependent on others.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Yet some of the Thessalonians refused to work. Paul dealt with these idle Christians in his first letter to them (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.11-12">1 Thes 4:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.14">5:14</a>), but they remained entrenched and had not changed their ways. Why did they refuse to work? Possibly, these believers so vividly expected a quick return of the Lord that they gave up all work. Paul’s teaching about the coming of the Lord, however, never contradicted his basic instruction about the necessity of work (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.6">2 Thes 3:6</a>, <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.10">10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">These idle Christians may have been clients of prominent patrons. Patronage was a fundamental feature of the Roman economic world. Rich patrons often supported numerous clients in various ways, such as by giving them food or money and by representing them in public assembly. Having numerous clients increased the honor of a patron. However, being a client brought social obligations that Paul would have wanted the Thessalonian believers to avoid, especially because their patrons were most likely non-Christians.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul set for the Thessalonians an example of self-reliance. While he was among them, he supported himself (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">1 Thes 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.7-9">2 Thes 3:7-9</a>). Although Paul believed that “those who work deserve to be fed” (see <a href="?bref=Matt.10.10">Matt 10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.13-16">1 Cor 9:13-16</a>), he did not receive support from the Thessalonians (he did accept offerings from the Philippians, <a href="?bref=Phil.4.15-16">Phil 4:15-16</a>). Paul wanted the Thessalonians to know that he did not come to them as a smooth talker hoping for monetary gain (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.5">1 Thes 2:5</a>, <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">9</a>).

<title>Women’s Roles in the New Testament Church</title>
<refs>1Tim.2.11-15</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Women’s Roles in the New Testament Church</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Paul’s words in 1 Timothy regarding women’s roles in the church were intended to correct what was happening in Ephesus, but the extent to which this passage applies to other situations is a subject of discussion. The possible understandings include the following three:</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="ital">Universal Interpretation.</span> <a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Galatians 3:28</a> (“There is no longer . . . male and female”) does not negate creational gender distinctions and roles. Even if <a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Galatians 3:28</a> represents the ideal of equality in God’s eternal Kingdom, gender roles should still be ordered as outlined in <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.11-15">1 Timothy 2:11-15</a> for as long as this creation continues. By way of comparison, <a href="?bref=Matt.22.30">Matthew 22:30</a> discusses the status of marriage in the new creation—it differs from the structure of this creation outlined in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.23-24">Genesis 2:23-24</a>, and it applies to the present life only in a special and limited sense (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.3-5">1 Tim 4:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.11-12">Matt 19:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.29-35">1 Cor 7:29-35</a>). The structure of the new creation will be fully realized in the coming age, and it is not the ideal for the present time. Therefore, Christian women in all times and places must recognize their role in the created order of God. They must not teach men or exercise authority over men in the church (see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.2-16">1 Cor 11:2-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.34-35">14:34-35</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="ital">Polemical Interpretation.</span> Paul was addressing a particular situation created by the false teaching within the Ephesian church (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.18-20">1 Tim 1:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.1-5">4:1-5</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.6-9">2 Tim 3:6-9</a>). Evidence suggests that this teaching was disturbing family relationships (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.3">1 Tim 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.11">Titus 1:11</a>). It is possible that Ephesian women, caught up in the local heresy, were abusing <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-3.24">Genesis 1–3</a> in their teaching. They might have been asserting female domination in the final resurrection (which, according to some of the Ephesians, had already occurred; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.18">2 Tim 2:18</a>) and accentuated Adam’s blame for the Fall. Paul corrects their misreadings by alluding to the biblical text, but his point is not to make a universal statement about the status of women in the church. His concern is merely to silence the false teachers in Ephesus, including the women among them. <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.11-15">First Timothy 2:11-15</a> entails a rebuke with loss of privilege specifically for those false teachers.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><span class="ital">Cultural Interpretation.</span> Paul’s argument was not necessarily directed to a local problem in Ephesus, but it presupposes a strongly patriarchal society, both in concern for public decorum (women in their place, showing proper honor to men) and in handling <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.2.22">22</a>. This shows that Christians must respect cultural norms insofar as possible in their evangelistic mission (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.19-23">1 Cor 9:19-23</a>). In addition, most women in that society had limited training as teachers. Their society, in contrast to many twenty-first-century societies, usually educated women poorly. Because of that culture’s patriarchal structure, women would not normally have qualified as teachers and leaders. <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.11-15">First Timothy 2:11-15</a>, therefore, reflects the notion that properly qualified people should lead and teach. At the same time, there are examples in Paul’s writings and in the early church of women participating in various facets of ministry (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.18.26">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-7">Rom 16:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.5">1 Cor 11:5</a>). This leads to questions about the universal applicability of Paul’s statements on women in the church.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Christians continue to discuss these complex issues. Many Christians today subscribe to a complementarian viewpoint, affirming distinct gender roles in the church, while many others take an egalitarian position, supporting the notion that men and women share equal roles in the church. All Christians affirm, however, the equality of men and women with respect to their identity as beloved children of God (see <a href="?bref=Gal.3.26-28">Galatians 3:26-28</a>).</p>

<title>The Household</title>
<refs>1Tim.2.8-15</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Household</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The household was the basic unit of Greco-Roman society; it was believed that the stability of the state rested upon the stability of the household. Roles and responsibilities were well defined and deeply ingrained. The central concern was to maintain the “natural” ordering of authority and subordination, the violation of which would lead to degradation and corruption. In this framework, the husband-father-master was over all. The public space of society and government belonged to men, the private space of the home belonged to women. It was not uncommon for Greco-Roman orators to accuse new foreign cults (as Christianity was perceived) of corrupting and destabilizing society, precisely by threatening the structure of the household.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament household codes (see <a href="?bref=Eph.5.21-6.9">Eph 5:21–6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.18-4.1">Col 3:18–4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.8-15">1 Tim 2:8-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.1-2">6:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.1-3.8">Titus 2:1–3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.18-3.7">1 Pet 2:18–3:7</a>) were therefore not innovations, even if these catalogs were adapted by the apostles to fit the Christian faith and to address particular needs. In practice, the Christian faith would result in the significant modification of cultural norms. Yet wisdom and loving restraint were needed, because heedlessly violating cultural norms created destructive upheaval and threatened to bring disrepute, disgrace, and shame on the entire household—including Christ, its head. This seems to be the effect of certain false teachers in Ephesus, as discussed in 1 Timothy. In this context, the New Testament household codes guided Christian communities toward a life that (1) silenced the accusations of unbelievers that Christianity was a threat to the state; and (2) served as a compelling, winsome witness to the truth.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Mantle of Leadership</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The mantle of Christian leadership is the garb of servants who suffer for those they lead (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-45">Mark 10:35-45</a>). For Paul, the essence of good leadership was to provide an example that mirrored Christ’s own example. The cross of Christ was central for Paul, and it had total claim on his life. When he said, “I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death” (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.10">Phil 3:10</a>; see <a href="?bref=Col.1.24">Col 1:24</a>), he was speaking of more than emotional turmoil or even of dealing with sin. He meant suffering violently and bodily. Paul endured suffering for the sake of those to whom he proclaimed the Good News, always putting their salvation before his own physical well-being (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10">2 Tim 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.8-12">2 Cor 4:8-12</a>). The Christian leader’s life is a proclamation of Christ crucified, of God’s power through human weakness (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.8-10">2 Cor 12:8-10</a>), and of God’s wisdom despite human foolishness (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.18-31">1 Cor 1:18-31</a>). As Paul summoned Timothy to take up the mantle of leadership (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1-5">2 Tim 4:1-5</a>), he was also summoning Timothy to suffer with him (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.3">2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.5">4:5</a>), scorning the shame of the cross (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">1:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">If leadership does not orbit faithfully around Christ as its self-giving center, it ceases to be leadership in Christ and fails to understand the Good News, as it tends to revolve around self. But leadership that is modeled after Christ is other-directed and sacrificial (see <a href="?bref=Phil.2.3-8">Phil 2:3-8</a>). Such a leader is willing to endure suffering, knowing that those who have died with Christ will live with him and that those who endure hardship will reign with him (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.11-12">2 Tim 2:11-12</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Church Leaders</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Spontaneity and spiritual giftedness characterized the first church gatherings (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26-33">1 Cor 14:26-33</a>). The apostles exercised general oversight of the Christian communities (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.2">Acts 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.14">8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">14:23</a>) together with the elders in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.4">Acts 15:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.6">6</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.22-23">22-23</a>), whose function was drawn from the Jewish synagogue and Greco-Roman models. The titles and functions of Christian leaders in communities outside of Jerusalem appear to have been fluid (e.g. <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">Acts 6:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>), but local leaders were dependent on the apostles when possible. Teachers and prophets also had important roles in guiding the church (see <a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-30">Acts 11:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26-40">1 Cor 14:26-40</a>). Churches were often founded before their leaders were appointed (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Titus 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">Acts 14:23</a>). Such appointments were related to spiritual gifting (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28-30">1 Cor 12:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11-13">Eph 4:11-13</a>) and (in some situations) to age.</p>
<p class="theme-body">There were likely always community leaders, whether or not they occupied a formal office. In the letters to Timothy and Titus, however, there is a strong emphasis on the offices of elder, overseer, and deacon. How these offices developed over the years is unclear, and even the practices described in 1 Timothy and Titus might not have been universal. Elders in Ephesus and on Crete may have carried more of a teaching role because the false teachers had to be decisively counteracted. Otherwise, the problems implied in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26-33">1 Corinthians 14:26-33</a> might have prevailed. These letters are more concerned with ensuring that the Good News be faithfully transmitted than with perpetuating a specific form of church government.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The apostle Paul exercised influence and control over his entire mission field, but there is no evidence that he intended to build or leave a regional or mission-wide infrastructure of governance. Apparently, the overseers were to carry on the teaching and disciplinary roles of Paul and his delegates without the wider responsibilities and authority of the apostles. As leaders of the local church, they wielded real and distinctive authority within their communities (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.3-5">1 Cor 5:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.11-16">1 Tim 4:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.19-22">5:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.14-19">2 Tim 2:14-19</a>, <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.25-26">25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.15">Titus 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.10-11">3:10-11</a>). Yet it was not long after the death of the apostles that church structure began to take a more centralized form—largely around the office of bishop—as evidenced in Christian writings from the early second century.</p>

<title>Slavery</title>
<refs>Phlm.1.8-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Slavery in the New Testament Period</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Slavery was an accepted way of life in the Roman world. Prisoners of war were often made slaves, many were born into slavery, and individuals could voluntarily become slaves for a period of time to work off a debt. A large percentage of the population, including many Christians, were either slaves or freed slaves (see <a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>). Why, then, did Paul not denounce slavery?</p>
<p class="theme-body">There appear to be two reasons. First, slavery in the Roman world was very different from the kind of slavery familiar to the Western world. Slavery was not race-based, and it was seldom lifelong; most slaves could expect to be freed by the age of thirty. In fact, a number of people sold themselves into slavery for upward social mobility into otherwise unattainable social circles. Some slaves were well educated and held responsible positions in their households and in society; many had amicable relations with their masters. In the Roman world, Christians like Philemon would have felt no compunction about owning slaves.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The second reason that Paul did not decry the institution of slavery was that his calling was not to change the structures of society, but to build the church—to see people converted and their lives spiritually transformed. For Paul, whether a believer is a slave or not is somewhat irrelevant, as are external circumstances generally; the important thing is serving Christ, whatever one’s situation in life. In other words, Paul is more concerned with Christian life and witness than with physical emancipation. So even slaves can do their work as an act of worship (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.5-8">Eph 6:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.22-24">Col 3:22-24</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.1-2">1 Tim 6:1-2</a>). When Paul addresses Christian slaves, he encourages them to accept their lot as a calling in which they can serve Christ; he is their real Master, and in him they are really free (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.20-24">1 Cor 7:20-24</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paradoxically, every Christian (whether slave or free), having been freed from the most tragic form of slavery—slavery to sin—can now experience true freedom by living as a slave of God and of righteousness (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.6-22">Rom 6:6-22</a>). For Paul, this is the only kind of slavery and freedom that is ultimately significant.</p>

<title>The Superiority of the Son</title>
<refs>Heb.1.1-3.6</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Superiority of the Son</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The author of Hebrews argues for the superiority of the Son as to both his person and his ministry. The superiority of the Son’s <span class="ital">person</span> is presented primarily in <a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-3.6">1:1–3:6</a>. In the book’s introduction (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-4">1:1-4</a>), the Son is presented as the creator, sustainer, and heir of the universe (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2-3">1:2-3</a>), one who “radiates God’s own glory and expresses the very character of God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">1:3</a>). He is the exalted one, who has achieved the cleansing of sins and has a status “far greater than the angels” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3-4">1:3-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In <a href="?bref=Heb.1.5-14">1:5-14</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.2.5-18">2:5-18</a>, the Son is shown to be superior to the angels. He has a unique relationship with the Father (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.5">1:5</a>) and is the ruler, creator, and terminator of the created order (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.8-12">1:8-12</a>). The angels have a status that is inferior to him, and they worship him (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.6-7">1:6-7</a>). God the Father exalts him to the highest possible position of honor at his right hand (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Ps 110:1</a>), and he has authority over all things (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.5-8">Heb 2:5-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In <a href="?bref=Heb.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>, the author builds on the hearers’ great respect for Moses to make the case for the even greater respect due the Son. Like Moses, the Son was faithful in his ministry to the people of God. Yet the Son deserves more glory and praise than Moses, for he is identified with God the Father and is the ultimate builder of God’s house (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.3-4">3:3-4</a>). The Son is ultimately in charge of God’s people (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.5-6">3:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The passages that focus on the superiority of the Son’s <span class="ital">ministry</span> are found primarily in <a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-10.18">7:1–10:18</a>. Through his superior high priesthood, Jesus has brought in a “better hope” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.19">7:19</a>), grounded in a “better covenant” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.22">7:22</a>), based on “better promises” (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6">8:6</a>), through which he performs a ministry “superior” to that of the priests of the old covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6">8:6</a>). Christ’s ministry under the new covenant is a “better system” because of the superiority of his sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.10">9:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.9.23">23</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Heb.12.24">12:24</a>). His ministry causes new-covenant believers to anticipate “better things” in terms of their inheritance (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.34">10:34</a>), a “better . . . heavenly homeland” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.16">11:16</a>), and a “better life after the resurrection” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.35">11:35</a>). For new-covenant believers in Christ, God has something “better” that could only be anticipated by their old-covenant counterparts (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.40">11:40</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Apostasy</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Sadly, opposition to God is not limited to those outside the community of faith; the Bible tells of many people who seemed to know God but turned away (see <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">Num 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-18">Deut 13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1-18">Ezek 8</a>). God brings just consequences to those who turn away from him (<a href="?bref=Job.11.20">Job 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.1.24-31">Prov 1:24-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.11">Jer 11:11</a>). Jesus spoke of those who fall away and the judgment they will receive (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Matt 16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.13">23:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.10-13">24:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41-46">25:41-46</a>), and the writers of the New Testament follow his lead (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.6-9">Gal 1:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.1-9">2 Tim 3:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1-22">2 Pet 2:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18-19">1 Jn 2:18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Bible as a whole is clear that disobeying God has severe consequences (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.9.5-6">Gen 9:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.35.16-21">Num 35:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.10">Lev 20:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.5.4">Zech 5:4</a>). Those who oppose God’s will and rule will ultimately be excluded from his life-giving presence (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.14-24">Isa 66:14-24</a>). In this vein, several passages in Hebrews warn that those who fail to take God’s word seriously are in deep spiritual trouble and will face the judgment of God (see <a href="?bref=Heb.2.1-4">Heb 2:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.12-13">4:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-8">6:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.26-31">10:26-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.25-29">12:25-29</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Scholars have understood the nature of the <span class="ital">apostasy</span> (falling away) and judgment described in the “warning passages” of Hebrews in various ways: (1) Some have understood the warnings to be hypothetical, suggesting that the harshness serves simply to shock the hearers out of spiritual lethargy, with no impending judgment in view. (2) A second position holds that those with whom the author was concerned were Jewish and had not yet converted to Christianity. Thus they were under God’s judgment because they were not yet a part of the new covenant. (3) A third view argues that the “apostates” in view were Christians who, because of their spiritual condition, faced some measure of God’s judgment as believers, but were in no danger of actually losing their salvation. (4) A fourth view suggests that the apostates had been full members of the Christian community and had experienced the full reality of the Christian faith but had now turned their backs on Christ and the church. (5) A fifth view is that, rather than having been true believers, the apostates showed that they never really knew Christ in the first place.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Ultimately, warnings of judgment are an expression of God’s grace, seeking to turn the rebellious person to the ways of God. Taking the consequences of apostasy seriously can help us build resolve in faithfully following Jesus.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">God’s Sabbath Rest</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The concept of God’s Sabbath rest, as found in <a href="?bref=Heb.4.1-11">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>, has been a theological puzzle for commentators. The notion carries various connotations from the Old Testament, including the Promised Land as a place to rest from slavery and wandering and the Sabbath day as a weekly day of rest. In <a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-19">Hebrews 3:7-19</a>, the author expounds on <a href="?bref=Ps.95.7-11">Psalm 95:7-11</a> and offers the wilderness wanderers as an example of those who failed to enter God’s rest because of their disobedience.</p>
<p class="theme-body">But what is this “rest” they failed to enter, which still remains for the people of God (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.1-3">Heb 4:1-3</a>)? The author of Hebrews clearly had more in mind than the physical land of Canaan as the place of “special rest” (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.8-9">4:8-9</a>). <a href="?bref=Gen.2.2">Genesis 2:2</a> speaks of God’s rest as something that he prepared from the foundation of the world (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.3-4">Heb 4:3-4</a>). God’s rest relates to ceasing from one’s own work as God did from his (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.10">4:10</a>). This rest can be entered by those who “hear his voice,” don’t harden their hearts, and believe the Good News (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.4.7">7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the Old Testament, the Day of Atonement is called a “Sabbath day of complete rest” (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.29-31">Lev 16:29-31</a>). On that day, people ceased completely from their own work. In the new covenant, Jesus as our Great High Priest has offered a once-for-all sacrifice that decisively dealt with sin (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.7-28">9:7-28</a>). He has provided the ultimate atoning sacrifice, and he thus offers people a spiritual rest, which they enter by believing this Good News.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God’s rest that is available through Jesus has two aspects. First, those who believe in him have ceased from their own works—that is, they no longer work for God’s acceptance, but they trust in Christ’s finished work (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.8-9">Eph 2:8-9</a>) and enjoy the blessings of peace with God (<a href="?bref=John.14.27">John 14:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.36">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1">Rom 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19-21">2 Cor 5:19-21</a>). Second, they look forward to an eternal life of rest and enjoyment in God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.19">Isa 26:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.13">Rev 14:13</a>).

<p class="theme-title">God’s Word</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">A foundational truth of Scripture is that God has spoken. The author of Hebrews, in line with other Jewish preachers of the era, presents the Old Testament as coming from the mouth of God, introducing those texts with “God says . . .” or something similar. God may speak a word of promise (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.13-14">Heb 6:13-14</a>) or a word of punishment (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.11">3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.11-12">4:11-12</a>); he may tell us something about himself or his Son (see <a href="?bref=Heb.1.5-12">1:5-12</a>) or reveal some aspect of his will (see <a href="?bref=Heb.8.7-13">8:7-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.5-7">10:5-7</a>). God’s word created the universe and still governs it (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.3-28">Gen 1:3-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.3">11:3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In the past, God’s word came primarily through angels or prophets, but now it has come preeminently in the person of Jesus, God’s Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-4">Heb 1:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.3-4">2:3-4</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=John.1.1-14">John 1:1-14</a>). The word is to be heard, heeded, obeyed, and believed as a source of hope.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Through his word, God initiates relationship with us and wants us to listen to him and respond in faith (see <a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gen 15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.12">John 1:12</a>). His word is authoritative and intentional, and it gives profound hope because God can be trusted to keep his promises (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.13-20">Heb 6:13-20</a>).</p>

<title>Spiritual Maturity</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Spiritual Maturity</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">When a person turns to Christ for salvation, it marks the beginning of a journey that will continue the rest of their life. Such a person does not simply remain as they are; they are transformed, growing continually into Christlikeness—a process often referred to as sanctification. Just as newborn babies drink milk in order to grow—eventually being able to eat solid food—new believers must avail themselves of “spiritual milk” in order to “grow into a full experience of salvation” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.1-3">1 Pet 2:2-3</a>), eventually consuming the “solid food” of deeper teaching (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.11-14">Heb 5:11-14</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Spiritual maturity has to do with one’s ability to discern spiritual truth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.6">1 Cor 2:6</a>). Christians are exhorted to be mature in their thinking (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.20">1 Cor 14:20</a>). The body of Christ grows to maturity through the equipping of believers and by growing in knowledge of the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.11-16">Eph 4:11-16</a>). The result is a united community of faith in which love and truth further build up the body of Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The audience of Hebrews was spiritually immature. The author wanted to give them real spiritual meat, but they were acting like spiritual babies who needed basic nourishment rather than deeper teaching (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">5:12</a>). They had not been listening to the word of God. They had been believers long enough to be teaching others, but a growing insensitivity had rendered them spiritually dull (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.11-12">5:11-12</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.1-3">1 Cor 3:1-3</a>). They lacked the maturity to discern the basic difference between right and wrong (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.14">Heb 5:14</a>). Thus, the author challenged them to move on to maturity so he could present them with deeper truths of the faith, rather than repeatedly recounting the basics (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.1-3">6:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Spiritual maturity is not an automatic result of time. It results from focused listening to the word of God and living out that word in fellowship with a community of believers.</p>

<p class="theme-title">Endurance</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">As Jesus was approaching his suffering and death, he informed his followers that they, too, would experience immense hardship (see <a href="?bref=Matt.24.9">Matt 24:9</a>). In that context, he underlines the role of endurance: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.13">Matt 24:13</a>). Sure enough, many of the writings of the New Testament were directed toward believers who were experiencing suffering for their faith in Christ (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.4">2 Thes 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">1 Pet 4:12-19</a>). These believers needed encouragement in order to persevere in the face of hardship while maintaining their commitment to Christ and their witness to others (see <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.5">2 Tim 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1">1 Pet 4:1</a>). Through endurance, believers experience growth in their character and develop spiritual maturity (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.3-4">Rom 5:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.2-4">Jas 1:2-4</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The book of Hebrews was written to a group of believers who had experienced a number of difficulties in the past including harassment, loss of property, and imprisonment (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.32-34">Heb 10:32-34</a>). At the time of writing, they were experiencing similar circumstances. Thus they needed to “hold firmly” to what they believed “without wavering” (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.23">10:23</a>) and to endure while anticipating the fulfillment of God’s promises (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.12">6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.36">10:36</a>). Like runners in a race, they needed to stay on the path of obedience (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.1">12:1</a>). And like true children of a loving father, they were to receive the Lord’s discipline in order to grow in holiness (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-13">12:5-13</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">All believers can look to the great examples of endurance in Scripture, including Job and the prophets (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.35-40">Heb 11:35-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.10-11">Jas 5:10-11</a>). Christ, our ultimate model of endurance, “endured the cross,” knowing the “joy awaiting him” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.1-3">12:1-3</a>). Our endurance is fueled by that same hope for the future.</p>

<p class="theme-title">By Faith</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Faith is a foundational theme in Scripture, yet misconceptions about faith abound. Some see faith as meaning any form of spirituality (“he/she is a person of faith”). Others understand it as a resolute belief that something good is going to happen to them—it is a ticket to health and wealth. Still others think that faith is a blind leap against known facts. None of these ideas constitutes biblical faith.</p>
<p class="theme-body"><a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-40">Hebrews 11</a>, one of the most loved passages of Scripture, provides an extensive essay on faith. It describes faith as involving confident action in response to what God has made known. As seen in the examples listed throughout the chapter, faith comes into play in a variety of life’s circumstances. The results of faith also vary. Some people get rescued, achieve success in life, and get some of what God has promised in their lifetimes. Others get mocked, beaten, tortured, put in prison, and killed. Faith is sometimes rewarded sooner and sometimes later, but regardless, people of faith anticipate the rewards because of their confidence in God’s character.</p>
<p class="theme-body">What does it mean to live by faith? It means that in our various circumstances we live out our belief “that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.6">11:6</a>). Those who live by faith take confident action based on what God has revealed about his character, seeking to do his will in all things.</p>

<refs>Heb.13.1-6</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Love in the Community of Christ</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Life in community is not always easy. The community of Christ—the church—has been prone to disunity and division throughout its history. Even in its earliest days, the church stuggled with issues of unity (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.11-17">1 Cor 1:11-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-16">Gal 2:11-16</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The answer to relational discord in the community of Christ is to exercise love toward our brothers and sisters in Christ. This command is grounded in the teaching of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37-40">Matt 22:37-40</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.34-35">John 13:34-35</a>; see <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lev 19:18</a>), is expressed by Paul (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">1 Cor 13:1-13</a>), and is found elsewhere in the New Testament (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.22">1 Pet 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.7-11">1 Jn 2:7-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.10">3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.7">4:7</a>). Loving others in the body of Christ is central to a Christian ethic (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.9-10">Rom 12:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.9">1 Thes 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.5-8">2 Pet 1:5-8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">This kind of love refers not to an emotion but to a commitment to meet others’ needs which is acted upon in concrete expression. In other words, followers of Christ are to relate to one another in such a way that our communities of faith are characterized by acts of love. The author of Hebrews provides an example of how love can be expressed in tangible ways within Christian communities: by showing hospitality, caring for the needs of those who are persecuted or imprisoned, being faithful in one’s marriage, and rejecting a life motivated by money (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.1-6">Heb 13:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Great confusion exists in the world about the nature of love and the character of the church. Therefore, there is a great need for the church to live out the Lord’s command to “keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.1">Heb 13:1</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Coming of the Lord as Judge</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Bible is clear that there will be a day of judgment (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.3">Jas 5:3</a>), and the book of James provides followers of Christ with both a warning and a promise regarding that day. James announces the future coming of the Lord as Judge (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.7-9">Jas 5:7-9</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Isa.26.21">Isa 26:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.1.3">Mic 1:3</a>). God, who gave the law, is the Judge who has the power to save and destroy (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.12">4:12</a>). Those who slander Jesus Christ and oppress his followers will be slaughtered (see <a href="?bref=Jas.2.6-7">2:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.5-6">5:5-6</a>). If those who follow Christ neglect to show mercy (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.13">2:13</a>), befriend the world (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.4">4:4</a>), sin through speech (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.11">4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.9">5:9</a>), or live to satisfy evil desires (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.1">4:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Jas.4.16">16</a>), they, too, will be judged by the law that was intended to set them free (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.12">2:12</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The Lord’s future coming influences present realities. God already honors the faithful poor and humiliates the exploitative rich (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.9-10">1:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.2-3">5:2-3</a>). Christ’s followers have already become God’s prized possession as God is restoring all things (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.18">1:18</a>). James declares that we should obey the royal law of the messianic kingdom (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.8">2:8</a>), of which followers of Christ have become heirs (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">2:5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">The coming of the Lord may not be immediate, so James exhorts Christians to endure (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.3-4">1:3-4</a>) and wait patiently for Christ’s return (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.7-8">5:7-8</a>). They will receive the crown of eternal life (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">1:12</a>) and reap the harvest of righteousness sown by a life of faithfulness to God (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.18">3:18</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">In view of impending judgment, James exhorts Christ’s followers to resist the devil and to humble themselves before God (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.7">4:7</a>). We must grieve over sin, live with pure intentions and behavior (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.8-9">4:8-9</a>), and rescue any Christian brother or sister who is headed toward death (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.19-20">5:19-20</a>). Like Elijah, we must practice faith, prayer, and confession (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.13-18">5:13-18</a>). Like Job, we must endure suffering, discovering in the end the scope of God’s kindness and mercy (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.10">4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.11">5:11</a>).</p>

<refs>1Pet.1.14-2.12</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Holiness of God’s People</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">God called on the people of Israel to be holy because he had ransomed them from their slavery in Egypt (see <a href="?bref=Lev.11.45">Lev 11:45</a>). He has also ransomed us through Jesus Christ, who paid the price to release us from slavery to sin and death (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18">1 Pet 1:18</a>). God has paid the ultimate price to set us free: He has given “the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.19">1:19</a>). He has purchased our freedom from the empty way of life that people experience before coming to Christ.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At the heart of the lifestyle that God demanded of his people under the old covenant was the requirement that they be holy as God is holy (see <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lev 19:2</a>). God had rescued them from the domination of a cruel, foreign nation who served other gods; now they were to live as God’s people in the new land to which he was bringing them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Peter applies the same requirement to God’s people of the new covenant, those who have come to God through faith in Jesus Christ: “You must be holy in everything you do, just as God who chose you is holy” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.15">1 Pet 1:15</a>). This holiness has both a negative and a positive side. Negatively, to be holy is to separate <span class="ital">from</span> this world, to avoid the ways of thinking and acting that characterize people who do not know God. We turn away from our old sinful, pre-Christian lifestyle. As a result, God’s people truly are “temporary residents” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.17">1 Pet 1:17</a>)—their values do not stem simply from this present world. Positively, to be holy is also to be separate <span class="ital">for</span> God; it means that we imitate our Father and live out the values of our new homeland, the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Believers in Christ have been set free from the old, meaningless life and its values. We are to live as obedient children of our heavenly Father (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14">1 Pet 1:14</a>). Our Father has not only redeemed us in his love; he also, like a human father, disciplines his children. He will judge us “according to what [we] do” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.17">1:17</a>). For this reason, we must live before God in “reverent fear” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.17">1:17</a>), recognizing his holiness and majesty, and seeking by faith to express his holy character in our lives. The life of holiness is not merely an option for believers: We are justified by our faith, but authentic faith must always reveal itself in works of holiness that please our Father (see <a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">Jas 2:14-26</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The New Community</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The New Testament draws attention to the importance of the Christian community, an emphasis that sometimes gets lost in individualistic cultures. Though believers in Christ are individually converted and born again to a new life (<a href="?bref=John.3.3">John 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.23">1 Pet 1:23</a>), we are not intended to remain in isolation. God’s purpose is to build us together as “living stones” in his “spiritual temple” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pet 2:5</a>). God no longer inhabits a building on Mount Zion in Jerusalem; he now lives in and among his people by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The promise that God would rebuild his temple (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ezek 40–48</a>) has been fulfilled as God dwells among his people (see <a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a>), who themselves constitute the “temple” under the new covenant. Only as we join together in worship, praise, and service will we function in the way God intended. Christians enjoy together the wonderful blessing of being the people God has chosen to carry out his mission to the world.</p>
<p class="theme-body">As <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Peter 2:9</a> makes clear, the church is now what Israel was originally, a “chosen people” (see <a href="?bref=Deut.7.6">Deut 7:6</a>), “royal priests,” “a holy nation” (see <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Exod 19:6</a>), and God’s “very own possession” (see <a href="?bref=Exod.19.5">Exod 19:5</a>). With that privileged status comes the responsibility to proclaim God to the nations. As we join in harmonious worship and together serve in various ministries, we “show others the goodness of God” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pet 2:9</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Christian Suffering</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">We should not be surprised when suffering comes (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12">1 Pet 4:12</a>). Christians who live a countercultural lifestyle in obedience to God should expect the culture to respond with hostility. We should expect mockery, discrimination, trumped-up charges, and even violence.</p>
<p class="theme-body">God has a purpose for us in suffering: It brings us into fellowship with Christ, who suffered before he was glorified (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.13">4:13</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.8.17">Rom 8:17</a>). By suffering in fellowship with Christ, we can be confident of enjoying the glory that he has already won.</p>
<p class="theme-body">First Peter focuses heavily on Christian suffering, especially unjust persecution at the hands of people hostile to the faith. The several themes about suffering that are woven throughout the letter find their climactic expression in <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">4:12-19</a>.</p>
<p class="theme-body">We need to commit ourselves to doing what is right when we face suffering (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>). Our difficulties can always provide an excuse for sinning, but when difficulties come our way, we must live exemplary lives, characterized by love for others. Our loving response to enemies in the midst of trials can be a powerful opportunity to share our faith. By treating our persecutors with love and kindness, we can make our faith respectable and even attractive to them.</p>
<p class="theme-body">We need to remember in our trials that God is both sovereign and faithful (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>). He controls all the circumstances of life, and we don’t need to fear that a trial will come our way apart from God’s oversight or will.</p>

<title>Early Christian Heresies</title>
<refs>1Jn.5.5-8</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Early Christian Heresies</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The Greek word <span class="greek">hairesis</span>, originally meaning “choice,” designates a <span class="ital">sect</span> or <span class="ital">faction.</span> For example, the Sadducees were a sect within Judaism (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.17">Acts 5:17</a>), as were the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">Acts 15:5</a>). The early believers in Jesus as the Messiah were known as “the sect of the Nazarenes” (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">Acts 24:5</a>). In each of these verses, the word <span class="greek">hairesis</span> denotes nothing more than a sect.</p>
<p class="theme-body">After the church grew and developed, any factious group within a local church was called a <span class="greek">hairesis</span>—that is, a sect that held opinions contrary to the truths established by the apostles. This is what Paul meant when he warned the Corinthian church that factious <span class="ital">sects</span> would develop among them (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.19">1 Cor 11:19</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Eventually, the word <span class="ital">heresy</span> came to connote teaching that deviates from the norm and causes individuals to break away from orthodoxy. Thus, Peter warned Christians about false teachers who would try to deceive believers with their heretical teachings (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1">2 Pet 2:1</a>). In the modern era, this is how the word <span class="ital">heresy</span> is usually understood; it is unorthodox teaching that damages the faith of some believers and causes divisive factions within the church.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Two heresies were particularly prevalent in the church around the time of John’s writings: Gnosticism and Docetism.</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="bold">Gnosticism</span> is characterized by claims to obscure and mystical knowledge. Many Gnostics believed in a hierarchy of beings in which there was an eternal god, from whom came a series of emanations of lesser spiritual beings, including the creator god, who was considered evil. This creator god fashioned the material world, including human beings. Thus, bearing similarities with Platonic thought, this strand of Gnostics believed that everything material was evil and that there was a more “real” spiritual realm. The goal for these Gnostics was to discover the spiritual seed within them—through secret knowledge (gnōsis)—which would enable them to leave the physical realm and join the spiritual realm. This generated varied responses to the physical realm, with some Gnostics practicing strict, ascetic avoidance of physical pleasure, while others indulged heavily in the “flesh,” regarding their actions in relation to this world as inconsequential.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Gnosticism developed through the interweaving of Christianity with Greek philosophy and emphasizes the need for additional, special knowledge that redefines the terms and practices of orthodox Christianity into something quite different. The Gnostics often incorporated Christ into their belief system, considering the Christ to be one of the various emanations from the supreme being. According to many Gnostics, this Christ taught some of his followers how to discover the spiritual spark within them and join the spiritual realm.</p>
<p class="theme-body">A significant amount of Christian writings from the first couple of centuries of the church’s existence were penned as a response to Gnostic heresy.</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><span class="bold">Docetism</span>, a form of Gnosticism, held that Christ only seemed to have a human body with physical birth, death, and resurrection (<span class="greek">dokeō</span> is a Greek verb meaning “to seem”). An early Docetist was Cerinthus, who argued that the spiritual “Christ” came upon the human Jesus at his baptism and was present with him during his ministry, but departed prior to his suffering and death. This movement was concerned with protecting the divinity of God from being polluted by the human nature of Jesus. According to early church tradition, John vehemently opposed Cerinthus’s teachings (see Irenaeus, <span class="ital">Against Heresies</span> 3.3.4; cp. <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.5-8">1 Jn 5:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">True Christians believe in the Incarnation—God becoming a real human being with flesh and blood. Jesus’ humanity was not a facade. He was truly human, sharing our flesh and blood, so that he could provide salvation for humanity through his own flesh and blood. Ignatius, a student of the apostle John and later the bishop of Antioch, wrote a series of letters refuting Docetism. Ignatius was the first one outside the New Testament writers to speak of the virgin birth of Jesus. He also emphasized the fact that the apostles touched the body of their risen Lord, and he said it was possible for him to face martyrdom with courage because of the real suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross and his physical resurrection.</p>

<title>Letters to the Seven Churches</title>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">Letters to the Seven Churches</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">In the letters to the seven churches of Asia (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">Rev 2–3</a>), John uses a single literary pattern. Each letter begins with an address to the “angel of the church” in a particular city, followed by an aspect of Christ’s appearance taken from the vision of the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.12-18">1:12-18</a>). Christ states that he knows each church and describes the state of the church in that city. He then gives advice or judgment for the church along with a promised reward for obedience. Each time, Christ emphasizes the need for full attention to the Spirit’s message to the churches.</p>
<p class="theme-body">It is common for interpreters to separate the seven letters into seven distinct messages and to make them symbolic of seven types of people or seven distinct periods of time. However, the seven letters were first of all letters from Christ to specific local churches in Asia. Christ knows each local congregation, and he encourages each to follow him faithfully. These letters also form a single, unified message that can speak to the church in all times and places, taking into account all its spots and wrinkles. In other words, any single body of Christians might be similar to one of these churches, and each community contains people who are like the Christians from these churches. Christ invites every community of believers to examine itself in the light of all of these messages.</p>

<title>Security and Obedience</title>
<refs>Rev.2.1-3.22</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">Security and Obedience</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The thought of one’s name being erased from the Book of Life (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.5">Rev 3:5</a>) may raise questions about the security of salvation: Doesn’t the New Testament assure believers that their salvation is secure?</p>
<p class="theme-body">The New Testament is filled with words of assurance (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.10.27-30">John 10:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.13">1 Cor 10:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.18-20">Heb 6:18-20</a>), but it also contains stern warnings (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.15.6">John 15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.6-12">1 Cor 10:6-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-8">Heb 6:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.4-5">Rev 2:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.11">3:11</a>). We often dislike and avoid the warnings because they threaten our sense of security. Yet this concern for security is the precise reason that the New Testament writers issued their warnings. They stressed the importance of obedience, faithfulness, and endurance.</p>
<p class="theme-body">This call to obedience was nothing new. God repeatedly called the people of Israel to be faithful (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-2">Gen 12:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-18">15:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.22.16-18">22:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.13-14">28:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.19-25">1 Sam 12:19-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.10-11">15:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.16-19">28:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.11-16">2 Sam 7:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.4-9">1 Kgs 9:4-9</a>). All the promises and predictions of God are conditioned upon faithfulness and obedience (see especially <a href="?bref=Jer.18.7-10">Jer 18:7-10</a>). Paul realized that the disobedience of Israel had led to some of them being “broken off” (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.17">Rom 11:17</a>), and he clearly warned Gentile Christians not to become overconfident of their position (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.13-32">Rom 11:13-32</a>). The promise of God is unchanged, but human disobedience brings judgment. Humble obedience and dependence on God are the basis for genuine security.</p>
<p class="theme-body">At the time when the New Testament was written, it was costly and threatening to be a Christian. The book of Revelation promises a secure hope for believers in Christ despite the threat of death, but this hope is set clearly within the context of warnings about judgment (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">Rev 21:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.21.27">27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.15">22:15</a>). The call to faithfulness and obedience is a major theme in Revelation (see <a href="?bref=Rev.2.5">2:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10-11">10-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.2.16-17">16-17</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.2.26-29">26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.2">3:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">12</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.3.17-19">17-19</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.3.21-22">21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.14">7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.9-10">13:9-10</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.13.12">12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.15">16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.4">18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12">20:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.7">21:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.3">22:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.22.7">7</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.22.11-12">11-12</a>). The New Testament clearly affirms that with God’s help, faithful Christians will persevere to the end (see <a href="?bref=Heb.13.6">Heb 13:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.25">Jas 1:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.10">Rev 3:10</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">The Theater and Revelation</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Understanding the ancient theater can help us to understand <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-5.14">Revelation 4–5</a>. This passage introduces a divine drama and highlights the significance of God’s agent (the Messiah) in world history. This passage also sets the stage for the great drama of the book, which is about the world, the reality of judgment, and the victory that comes through the Lamb. In these chapters, a series of tableaus (scenes) is used to communicate the message.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The passage opens by describing God on his heavenly throne (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>). In the ancient theater, a divine persona was placed in a central box or throne high above the stage. This actor clarified the significance of each scene for the audience through positive and negative comments or solved dilemmas in the script when they became too complex for the characters on stage to handle. Similarly, readers of Revelation should watch for scenes where God or his messengers interpret or intervene to advance the message.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The ancient drama took place on the stage below the divine figure. Between the stage and the audience, an orchestra of speakers voiced the emotional climate of the play. In Revelation, the four living creatures have a similar role (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.6-8">4:6-8</a>). The twenty-four elders (representatives of the old and new covenants; <a href="?bref=Rev.4.4">4:4</a>) provide an antiphonal chorus (alternating groups of speakers or singers) and the historical setting for this great drama. God supplies the script, and only his special agent, the Lamb, can open it, read it, and perform it (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.1-5">5:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.1">6:1</a>).</p>

<p class="theme-title">Symbolic Numbers</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Numbers used in Scripture have often inspired wild speculation. An understanding of the symbolism of numbers in the ancient world can help ground our interpretation. Such symbolism, however, is not rigid or exact, so great care must be exercised when numbers are used in interpretation, so as not to push fanciful predictions about future events.</p>
<p class="theme-body">The number <span class="ital">one</span> can refer to God’s oneness (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">Deut 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.20">Gal 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.19">Jas 2:19</a>). <span class="ital">Two</span> is the minimum number required to give a legitimate witness (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.6">Deut 17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.3">Rev 11:3</a>), and <span class="ital">three</span> can imply divine representation (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-2">Gen 18:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.14">2 Cor 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.4-5">Rev 1:4-5</a>). <span class="ital">Four</span> can stand for the known world, represented in Revelation by living creatures, horsemen, winds, and angels (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.6-8">Rev 4:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1">7:1</a>) and in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-50.26">Genesis</a> by <span class="ital">four</span> rivers (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.10-14">Gen 2:10-14</a>).

The multiplication of <span class="ital">three</span> by <span class="ital">four</span> yields <span class="ital">twelve,</span> the number associated with God’s people (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.22-26">Gen 35:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">Exod 24:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.28.21">28:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.17.2">Num 17:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.4.3-8">Josh 4:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.31">1 Kgs 18:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.1-4">Matt 10:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">Jas 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1">Rev 12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.12-22.2">21:12–22:2</a>. The number <span class="ital">five</span> and its multiples, such as <span class="ital">ten,</span> represent human completeness (e.g., <span class="ital">five</span> fingers per hand); and <span class="ital">six</span> carries a negative sense or implication of evil, being neither humanly complete (<span class="ital">five</span>) nor divinely complete (<span class="ital">seven</span>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Multiples of <span class="ital">ten</span> (e.g., <span class="ital">forty</span>) are a symbolic way to indicate <span class="ital">many</span>, whereas <span class="ital">three sixes</span> (666) imply supreme evil (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.18">Rev 13:18</a>). <span class="ital">One thousand</span> is regarded as the foundational large number; 12,000 indicates a large number of God’s people (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.5-8">Rev 7:5-8</a>); and 144,000 represents the complete people of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.4">Rev 7:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1">14:1</a>). The number 10,000 and its multiples are probably best transliterated from Greek as <span class="ital">myriads</span>, since they really mean “a huge number” rather than a precise count.</p>
<p class="theme-body">While some of the numbers in the Bible have symbolic meanings, using numbers to speculate on the time of Christ’s return or of the end of the world is highly dubious—only God possesses that knowledge (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.32">Mark 13:32</a>). God did not intend for the symbolic numbers in Revelation to help us predict the future; rather, their symbolic meanings help to explain the significance of the visions. Because the numbers are symbolic, sometimes when we translate them into contemporary sizes, distances, and numbers for our ease of reading, it can result in the loss of theological significance. The use of these symbolic numbers can illuminate a vision’s relationship to the world or to the people of God.</p>

<title>The Purpose of the Judgments</title>
<refs>Rev.2.24-29</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Purpose of the Judgments</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">What is the purpose of God’s judgments? Are they meant to bring about redemption or are they simply intended to destroy? The account of judgments in Revelation gives us some clues:</p>
<p class="theme-list-sp">At the end of the sixth trumpet, in spite of all the plagues, people “still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God” (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.20-21">9:20-21</a>). For some people, it does not matter what happens to them—they will not change even under pressure.</p>
<p class="theme-list">The tormented sufferers of the fifth trumpet sought death rather than looking to God (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.6">9:6</a>). Many prefer to die rather than to admit their sin.</p>
<p class="theme-list">In the sixth seal (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.12-17">6:12-17</a>), the people cried for the rocks to fall on them and hide them from “the wrath of the Lamb” (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.16">6:16</a>). Their seeking escape from judgment shows fear rather than trusting in God.</p>
<p class="theme-list">Revelation emphasizes the ultimate justice of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.16.5-7">16:5-7</a>) and the principle of retribution. Believers and unbelievers alike will receive exactly what they deserve (see <a href="?bref=Rev.2.23">2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.18">11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.13">14:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.6">18:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12-13">20:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.12">22:12</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">The judgments are God’s partial answer to the prayers of the saints for retribution. Judgment occurs in God’s time, not ours (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.9-11">6:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.2-5">8:2-5</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">The judgments, like the plagues on Egypt, disprove the power of the earthly gods and of God’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.8-12">Exod 7:8-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.12">12:12</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rev.13.4-17">Rev 13:4-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.20-21">19:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.9-10">20:9-10</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-list">The judgments are a part of God’s mission and offer a last chance to repent (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.6-7">14:6-7</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rev.9.20-21">9:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.9">16:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.16.11">11</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.16.21">21</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body-sp">Even though God has made it clear that sin is wrong and judgment is coming (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.5-11">Rom 2:5-11</a>), many people still refuse to repent and accept God’s grace (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.32">Rom 1:32</a>). Even in the final days, when God sends his witnesses to prophesy concerning the coming destruction, many people will prefer to align themselves with evil forces and will gloat over the demise of God’s prophets (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.3-10">11:3-10</a>). Those who thus oppose God and flee from him will eventually be excluded from his presence.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Judgment against disobedience and evil ways is inevitable (see <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-2.11">Rom 1:18–2:11</a>). Yet God patiently waits for repentance and offers his grace (see <a href="?bref=Rom.2.4">Rom 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.8-10">2 Pet 3:8-10</a>). As such, the warnings of these judgments can serve as an opportunity for change.</p>

<title>The Antichrist</title>
<refs>Rev.13.11-18</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Antichrist</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">The term <span class="ital">antichrist</span> appears only in John’s letters (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18">1 Jn 2:18</a>, <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.22">22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>). John expected many antichrists to appear in history (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18">1 Jn 2:18</a>), all of whom would deny that Jesus is both divine and human (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.22">1 Jn 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2-3">4:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">Paul speaks of a “man of lawlessness,” who will come in the last days to stir up rebellion against God (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-12">2 Thes 2:1-12</a>). This figure will “come to do the work of Satan,” chiefly by means of deception. Though not specifically labeled as “antichrist,” this “man of lawlessness,” like the “antichrists” described in John’s letters, will stand in opposition to the truth.</p>
<p class="theme-body">In <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">Revelation 13</a>, the hostile spirit opposed to Christ is personified by “another beast” who serves the dragon (Satan) and the first beast. The number of this antichrist, 666, probably stood for Nero and perhaps for the emperor Domitian (see <a href="?item=Rev.17.8_StudyNote_Filament">study note on 17:8</a>). Emperor worship—which proclaimed “Caesar is Lord!”—was a pseudo-religion that stood in opposition to proclaiming Christ as Lord.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Whether John expected a final antichrist even greater than a political figure like Nero or Domitian is uncertain. Either way, Christians must take seriously the presence of evil and its opposition to Christ in the people and power structures of the world. Resisting these enemies may lead to persecution and even death, but our hope rests in ultimate victory through Christ.</p>

<title>The Worship of Angels</title>
<refs>Rev.19.10</refs>
<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Worship of Angels</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl">Scripture often presents angelic figures as startling beings, whose appearance generates a response of awe or fear (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.5.13-15">Josh 5:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.8-10">Luke 2:8-10</a>). Yet angels have a servant role and are not to be worshiped (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.5-14">Heb 1:5-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.10">Rev 19:10</a>). Jewish tradition had developed the concept of angels as mediators. In pre-Christian Judaism, God’s <span class="ital">transcendence</span> or “otherness” was emphasized to such an extent that people felt mediators were needed in order to communicate with him. In this context, angels grew in importance.</p>
<p class="theme-body">For Christians, Christ has a unique role as mediator between God and humans. An interest in angels or deceased saints as providing a means to communicate with God can easily get in the way of honoring Christ as the sufficient mediator between God and human beings (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.5-6">1 Tim 2:5-6</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19-21">2 Cor 5:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.24-25">Heb 7:24-25</a>). God still has angelic messengers, but they are creatures who serve him, not divine beings to be worshiped. God alone is worthy of our prayers and our worship.</p>

<body>
<p class="theme-title">The Thousand Years (The Millennium)</p>
<p class="theme-body-fl"><a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a> describes the 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth. Three perspectives regarding how the millennium relates to the coming of Christ have been held by Christian groups with an equally high regard for Scripture as God’s inspired, authoritative word:</p>
<p class="theme-body">1. <span class="ital">Premillennialism:</span> The current age between Christ’s first and second comings will end when he returns to inaugurate a literal 1,000-year rule on earth with his holy people, after which Christ will execute the final judgment and inaugurate his eternal Kingdom.</p>
<p class="theme-body">2. <span class="ital">Amillennialism:</span> The “1,000 years” represents the current age between Christ’s first and second comings, in which Christ reigns spiritually with his people (i.e., there is not a literal 1,000-year period). At the end of this age, Christ will return, execute the final judgment, and inaugurate his eternal Kingdom.</p>
<p class="theme-body">3. <span class="ital">Postmillennialism:</span> During the current age following Christ’s first coming, Christ will establish through the church an age of peace on earth (the 1,000 years), at the end of which Christ will return, execute the final judgment, and inaugurate his eternal Kingdom.</p>
<p class="theme-body">Differences over these perspectives have caused conflict among Christians. Many have forsaken Christian fellowship with those who hold a different opinion. True Christian humility and love would never let such differences disrupt Christian fellowship, however (see <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.8">1 Pet 3:8</a>).</p>
<p class="theme-body">All believers can agree about the overall message of Revelation: Christ will visibly return and rule in an actual new heaven and earth. A real spiritual warfare is taking place. Hell, like heaven, is real, and all people will be judged by God’s standards. The prophecies of Revelation offer hope to God’s people in the midst of pain, suffering, and confusion in the world.</p>
