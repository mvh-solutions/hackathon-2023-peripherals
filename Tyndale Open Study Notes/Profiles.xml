<body>
<p class="profile-title">Adam and Eve</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Adam was the first man, the father of the human race. God created the first couple in his image to populate the earth and rule the created order (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-31">Gen 1:26-31</a>). God made Adam from the earth and breathed life into him (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">2:7</a>); he was to cultivate the garden in which God placed him (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.15">2:15</a>), name the animals (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.19-20">2:19-20</a>), and follow God’s instructions (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">1:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">2:16-17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">God created the first woman as a companion and helper for Adam (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.18-22">2:18-22</a>). Eve’s creation from Adam’s rib portrays the unity that God intended for man and woman in marriage (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.23-25">2:23-25</a>). She is honored as “the mother of all who live” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.20">3:20</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After the serpent deceived Eve into rejecting God’s rule, Adam also rebelled (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>). Their willful disobedience disrupted their relationship (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.7">3:7</a>) and separated them from God. God looked for Adam after his rebellion; he and Eve were hiding among the trees, already aware of the alienation (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8">3:8</a>). When God questioned him, Adam blamed Eve and, by implication, God (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.12">3:12</a>). Their rebellion brought pain, strained relationships, hardship in governing the earth, and death—physical and spiritual (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16-19">3:16-19</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.3.22-24">22-24</a>). Nonetheless, God provided animal skins to cover Adam and Eve (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.21">3:21</a>), and promised that Eve’s offspring would defeat Satan (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">3:15</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rom.16.20">Rom 16:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-9">Rev 12:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-10">20:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Adam was a historical individual (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.25">Gen 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-5">5:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1">1 Chr 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.7">Hos 6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.38">Luke 3:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.14">Rom 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.22">1 Cor 15:22</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">45</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.13-14">1 Tim 2:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.14">Jude 1:14</a>) who also represents humanity as a whole. God’s mandates (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-30">Gen 1:26-30</a>) and curses (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16-19">3:16-19</a>) affected not only Adam and Eve, but the entire human race. Adam represents separation from God, which all humanity experiences.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The apostle Paul contrasted those represented by Adam, the first man, with those who follow Christ, the “last Adam” (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Rom 5:12-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45-50">1 Cor 15:45-50</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.8.5-11">Rom 8:5-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.8.20-22">20-22</a>). Those represented by Adam live only after his example—they partake of his sin, his alienation from God and God’s creation, and his spiritual death. By contrast, those who follow Christ live by faith in him. They are recreated in Christ’s image and become “new people” who partake of a new creation (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.49">1 Cor 15:49</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">Gal 6:15</a>). The barriers Adam and Eve raised are removed by Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1">Rom 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.27-28">Gal 3:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-16">Eph 2:14-16</a>); Christ restores what they lost.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Noah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Noah was the son of Lamech, a descendant of Seth (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.3-29">Gen 5:3-29</a>). Lamech might have hoped that Noah (whose name means “rest” or “relief”) would ease the curse of hardship in working the ground. Instead, God used Noah to help relieve the world of evil.</p>
<p class="profile-body">God intended to destroy creation because of pervasive human wickedness (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-7">Gen 6:1-7</a>; see <a href="?bref=Matt.24.37-39">Matt 24:37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.26-27">Luke 17:26-27</a>), but he decided to preserve Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.8">Gen 6:8</a>). God gave Noah, a righteous and blameless man (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.9">Gen 6:9</a>), precise instructions for building the ark in which only the eight people of his family would be saved, along with every kind of creature (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.14-8.19">Gen 6:14–8:19</a>). When Noah and his family finally emerged from the ark after the flood, Noah pleased God by building an altar and sacrificing burnt offerings. God promised that he would never again flood the whole earth or disrupt the sequence of the seasons, despite human sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20-9.17">Gen 8:20–9:17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Noah’s sons were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. All the nations of the earth descended from them (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.18-19">Gen 9:18-19</a>). When Noah became drunk on wine from his vineyard, his sons and their descendants were cursed or blessed in accord with how they responded to him (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.20-27">Gen 9:20-27</a>). Noah lived for 950 years, including 350 years after the flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.28-29">Gen 9:28-29</a>). He is an example of righteousness, obedience, courage, and faith (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.12-20">Ezek 14:12-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">Heb 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.5">2 Pet 2:5</a>).</p>

<title>Melchizedek</title>
<refs>Gen.14.18-20</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Melchizedek</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Melchizedek is a mysterious biblical personality whose name means “king of righteousness.” He was a Canaanite priest and king; there is no record of his family or of the beginning or end of his life.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abraham met Melchizedek after defeating four Mesopotamian kings. The Mesopotamians had raided Sodom and Gomorrah and captured Abraham’s nephew Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-16">Gen 14:1-16</a>). When Abraham returned from battle, Melchizedek, king of Salem (=Jerusalem; see <a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">Ps 76:2</a> and footnote there), was with the grateful kings of the Dead Sea confederacy. When Melchizedek gave Abraham bread, wine, and his blessing, he was acting as “a priest of God Most High” (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18">Gen 14:18</a>), the true God who created heaven and earth (see <a href="?bref=Ps.7.17">Pss 7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.47.2">47:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.2">57:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.56">78:56</a>). Melchizedek correctly understood that Abraham worshiped the true God, and he praised God for giving victory to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.19-20">Gen 14:19-20</a>). Abraham received Melchizedek’s gifts and gave him a tithe, which demonstrated the prominence of Melchizedek (see <a href="?bref=Heb.7.4-10">Heb 7:4-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">While Genesis gives genealogies for many of its characters, Melchizedek appears suddenly without any such record, and he disappears just as quickly. Much later in Israel’s history, King David was perhaps reflecting on this when he said that the Messiah is “a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek” (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.4">Ps 110:4</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Heb.7.15-25">Heb 7:15-25</a>). The book of Hebrews picks up on this notion that Melchizedek had no genealogical record and uses it to compare the temporary Levitical priesthood with the eternal priesthood of Christ. The book of Hebrews also explains that Melchizedek is remembered as “resembling the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">Heb 7:3</a>), but was not himself the Son of God. His priesthood lasts forever as an archetype that prefigures the Messiah’s priesthood. Like Melchizedek (but unlike the kings of Israel), Jesus is a king who also fulfills priestly functions.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Melchizedek, a royal priest, was superior to Levi, the ancestor of Israel’s priests. In the same way, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, is a better priest than the descendants of Aaron. Jesus provides permanent atonement for sins and direct access to his Father (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.24-28">Heb 7:24-28</a>). He guides his people by the Spirit rather than by law (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.7-13">Heb 8:7-13</a>) and lives forever as priest and king for those who trust in him.</p>

<refs>Gen.16.1-16</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Hagar</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Hagar was the Egyptian servant of Sarai, Abram’s wife. When God commanded Abram to leave Mesopotamia, he promised him a multitude of descendants who would be given a new land (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">Gen 12:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.12.7">7</a>). After ten childless years in Canaan, Sarai followed a customary Mesopotamian practice by giving Hagar to Abram as his concubine; any son born of the union of husband and concubine was considered the wife’s child (cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-8">30:1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Hagar got pregnant and became disrespectful to Sarai during her pregnancy. Sarai responded by dealing harshly with her, and Hagar fled into the desert (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.4-6">16:4-6</a>). The angel of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> appeared to her at a desert well, telling her to return to Abram’s house and submit to Sarai.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Hagar bore a son, Ishmael, when Abram was eighty-six years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">16:1-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Fourteen years later, God gave Abraham and Sarah their promised son, Isaac. When Isaac was weaned (at about three years), a traditional feast was held. At this event, Ishmael mocked Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.9">21:9</a>), so Sarah insisted that Abraham send Hagar and Ishmael away. God affirmed this action (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.12">21:12</a>), so Hagar and Ishmael were sent away to wander in the wilderness of Beersheba. When their water was gone, God miraculously rescued them and assured Hagar that Ishmael would father a great nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.17-19">21:17-19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul made an analogy (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.22-31">Gal 4:22-31</a>) in which Hagar represents Mount Sinai, where the old covenant was formed, while Sarah represents the heavenly Jerusalem, the community of those who receive salvation by faith in Christ. As Isaac was Abraham’s son by faith in the divine promise, Christians who are free of the law are spiritual children of Sarah.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Ishmael</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Ishmael was Abraham’s first son, born of Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian servant. The boy was born near Hebron when Abraham was eighty-six years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">Gen 13:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.16.16">16:16</a>). God had promised to make a great nation of the childless Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">12:2</a>) and assured him that he would have a son to be his heir (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.4">15:4</a>). Ishmael was born in Abraham’s attempt to fulfill God’s promise by human means (see <a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">16:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.23">Gal 4:23</a>), but God would nevertheless accomplish his purposes through Sarah (see <a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-18">Gen 17:15–18:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-7">21:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When God announced that Sarah would have a son to fulfill the promise (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-16">17:15-16</a>), Abraham asked God to accept Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.17-18">17:17-18</a>). Ishmael was not the promised son—the covenant would be established with Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.19">17:19</a>)—but God did bless Ishmael and make him the father of a great nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.20-21">17:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">At age thirteen, Ishmael was circumcised in accordance with God’s covenant with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">17:9-14</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.17.23-27">23-27</a>). Later, at Isaac’s weaning celebration (when Ishmael was about seventeen), Ishmael made fun of Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.9">21:9</a>), and Abraham sent Ishmael and Hagar away with provisions. The angel of God helped Hagar survive in the wilderness, and Ishmael became a wild game hunter. He settled in the wilderness of Paran and married an Egyptian woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.20-21">21:20-21</a>). He assisted in Abraham’s burial (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.9-10">25:9-10</a>), gave his daughter Mahalath in marriage to Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.9">28:9</a>), and died at age 137 (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.17">25:17</a>). His twelve sons are named in <a href="?bref=Gen.25.13-15">Genesis 25:13-15</a>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul alluded to Ishmael when urging the Galatians to put their faith in God rather than in the law (see <a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-31">Gal 4:21-31</a>). Those who trust the law will not inherit the kingdom, just as the slave woman’s son did not inherit with the son of the free woman (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.30">Gal 4:30</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Sarah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Sarah was Abraham’s wife and half sister (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.29">Gen 11:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.20.12">20:12</a>). She accompanied Abraham from Ur to Haran to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.12.5">12:5</a>). On two occasions, in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.10-20">12:10-20</a>) and Gerar (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">20:1-18</a>), Abraham asked Sarah to say that she was his sister rather than his wife because he was afraid that he would be killed as her husband. In both cases, despite Abraham’s lack of faith, God protected Sarah, thus preserving the chosen line through whom he promised to multiply the Israelite nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.19">17:19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Sarah is one of several women in Scripture who were barren but miraculously bore a son (see also <a href="?bref=Gen.30.22-24">Gen 30:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.9-20">1 Sam 1:9-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.14-17">2 Kgs 4:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.5-25">Luke 1:5-25</a>). After a series of promises from God, Sarah eventually conceived and gave birth to Isaac. Because Sarah was ninety years old when this happened (cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">Gen 17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-5">21:1-5</a>), she testifies to God’s ability to do what is humanly impossible. Her name Sarai was changed to Sarah on one of the occasions when Isaac’s birth was promised (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-16">17:15-16</a>). Sarah is honored for her faithfulness, even though she laughed at the prediction of Isaac’s birth (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.10-15">18:10-15</a>), twenty-five years after God’s original promise to Abraham.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Sarah died at age 127 and was buried in the cave that Abraham purchased (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">Gen 23</a>) at Machpelah. She is known as the mother of the nation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.2">Isa 51:2</a>), just as Abraham is its father. She is a key player in accounts of Abraham’s faith (see <a href="?bref=Rom.4.19">Rom 4:19</a>). She represents the freedom that Christians have (as children of Sarah the free woman) through faith in Christ (see <a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-31">Gal 4:21-31</a>). Peter cites her as an example of holy submission (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.5-6">1 Pet 3:5-6</a>). The writer of Hebrews presents Sarah as an example of faith, for she believed in God’s ability to keep his promises (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.11-12">Heb 11:11-12</a>). Her life demonstrates that God is indeed faithful, though his timing may not always match our expectations.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Lot</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Lot was Abraham’s nephew and the ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites. Like Abraham, Lot was born in Ur and accompanied Terah to Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.27-32">Gen 11:27-32</a>). After Terah’s death, he joined Abraham in journeying to Canaan and Egypt.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Lot and Abraham returned from Egypt to Canaan, their flocks and herds grew too numerous for them to live together, so Abraham gave Lot his choice of land on which to settle. Lot chose the fertile plain of the Jordan that was like “the garden of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.10">Gen 13:10</a>), and eventually he took up residence in Sodom. Lot’s increasing involvement with the completely corrupt cities of the plain compromised him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">While Lot lived in Sodom, four Mesopotamian kings defeated the kings of five towns in the area; in the subsequent plundering, they carried off Lot, his family, and his possessions (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-12">Gen 14:1-12</a>). When word of this reached Abraham, he launched a rearguard action against the invaders and recovered the prisoners and property (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.13-16">14:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Because of the wickedness of Sodom and the neighboring city of Gomorrah, God decided to destroy these towns. He sent two angelic visitors to Lot in Sodom to encourage his departure from the doomed city (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-15">Gen 19:1-15</a>). The city’s depravity became even more evident in an attempted homosexual attack on the visitors. Lot’s willingness to sacrifice his daughters, along with his reluctance to leave Sodom, shows how corrupt and compromised he had become. No one but his immediate family accompanied him, and his wife was destroyed when she turned back in disobedience. Soon after the destruction of Sodom, Lot’s daughters, despairing of having no husbands, got Lot drunk enough to have sexual relations with them. Their two sons, Moab and Ben-ammi, were ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.30-38">Gen 19:30-38</a>), two nations that became inveterate enemies of Israel (see <a href="?bref=Deut.23.3-6">Deut 23:3-6</a>). Despite Lot’s waywardness, Peter declares that Lot was a “righteous man who was tormented in his soul by the wickedness he saw and heard day after day” (see <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.6-9">2 Pet 2:6-9</a>). This analysis of Lot may stem from Jewish interpretive tradition, as it is difficult to see in the Genesis account.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Isaac</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The name Isaac means “he laughs,” reflecting the circumstances of his birth. When God promised that Isaac would be born, both Abraham and Sarah first laughed in disbelief (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-19">Gen 17:15-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.9-15">18:9-15</a>). God had promised Abraham a son (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.4-6">15:4-6</a>), but no son had come, and Abraham and Sarah were beyond childbearing age. So at Isaac’s birth, they laughed for joy (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.6-7">21:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">During Isaac’s adolescence, God tested Abraham by telling him to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-19">22:1-19</a>). Abraham’s faith remained firm; he obeyed, and Isaac submitted to his father. God then intervened to provide a sacrificial ram in Isaac’s place. Abraham’s faith in God was rewarded with the promise of great blessings (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.15-18">22:15-18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Isaac married Rebekah and was ready to carry on the chosen line, but Rebekah was unable to bear children (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.21">25:21</a>). Rather than take matters into his own hands as his father had done (see <a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">16:1-16</a>), Isaac “pleaded with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” and Rebekah bore twin sons. Isaac favored Esau, the older son, while Rebekah preferred Jacob. This favoritism led to Isaac’s being deceived by his son Jacob when he was old and blind (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-40">27:1-40</a>). Favoritism remained a problem among Isaac’s descendants (see <a href="?bref=Gen.29.30">29:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.33.1-2">33:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.37.4">37:4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Isaac followed his father Abraham’s example in relating to surrounding nations. When visiting another kingdom during a famine, he fearfully claimed that his wife was his sister (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.1-11">26:1-11</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.10-20">12:10-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">20:1-18</a>). Like his father, Isaac became prosperous in that land and was asked to leave (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.12-16">26:12-16</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.16-20">12:16-20</a>); he experienced conflict over water and land with other herdsmen (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.17-22">26:17-22</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.21.25-31">21:25-31</a>); and he made a treaty with the king of the Philistines (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.26-31">26:26-31</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.21.22-32">21:22-32</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Isaac was given the same promise that his father had received (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.2-5">26:2-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.26.23-25">23-25</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.22.16-18">22:16-18</a>), and he demonstrated his participation by carrying on the practice of circumcision, which signified the covenant (see <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>). As the child of promise, Isaac represents all who are children of Abraham by faith in Christ and are thereby free to live as God’s children rather than as slaves (see <a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-5.1">Gal 4:21–5:1</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Hittites</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Hittites were once unknown to secular history and thought to be a mythical people by some critics of biblical history. But information about the Hittites has been uncovered by archaeologists and historians, and they are now known to have had an empire centered in Asia Minor, with their capital at Hattusha (modern Baghazkoy). At times the empire extended over a much larger area without definite boundaries since it included city-states that were dependencies by treaty. They were of sufficient military strength to challenge the armies of Egypt under the vainglorious Rameses II (1279–1213 <span class="era">BC</span>) and fought him to a standstill at Kadesh on the Orontes (ca. 1274 <span class="era">BC</span>). In patriarchal times, the Hittites held power in cities like Hebron in Canaan.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The progenitor of the Hittites, Heth, is listed second among the sons of Canaan in the “table of nations” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.15">Gen 10:15</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.13">1 Chr 1:13</a> and the textual footnote there). Most of the references to the sons of Heth appear in the narrative of the purchase of the cave of Machpelah by Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">Gen 23</a>). Later, God commanded the people of Israel to destroy all the Hittites living in the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-2">Deut 7:1-2</a>), but Israel did not completely do so (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-21">1 Kgs 9:20-21</a>). Some of David’s best warriors were from Hittite ancestry (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.6">1 Sam 26:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-12.31">2 Sam 11–12</a>), and Solomon engaged in trade with Hittite kings (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.29-11.1">1 Kgs 10:29–11:1</a>). The Bible thus suggests that the Hittites were a people of great consequence.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Rebekah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl"><a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-67">Genesis 24</a> describes the mission of Abraham’s servant to find a wife for Isaac. At Abraham’s command, he went to Haran in Aram-naharaim (northwest Mesopotamia), to Abraham’s relatives, because Abraham did not want Isaac to marry a local Canaanite. The servant prayed that the young woman God had selected to be Isaac’s wife would answer his request for a drink by immediately giving it and watering his camels as well (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.12-14">24:12-14</a>). This would not only serve to confirm God’s will in the matter but would also demonstrate her character, hospitality, and work ethic.</p>
<p class="profile-body">God decisively answered his prayer with Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.23">22:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.20">25:20</a>), the son of Abraham’s brother Nahor (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.24">24:24</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Abraham’s servant described how God had led him (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.34-49">24:34-49</a>), Rebekah’s family recognized it as God’s hand, but they were reluctant to let her go immediately (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.50-56">24:50-56</a>). Rebekah, however, demonstrated faith in God’s plan; she was willing to leave her family without delay to marry Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.57-58">24:57-58</a>). Rebekah’s faith was richly rewarded; the blessing her family gave her in parting (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.59-60">24:59-60</a>) came true when she bore to Isaac the next generation of God’s chosen line.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Rebekah bore twins, Esau and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.20-26">25:20-26</a>). She preferred Jacob, the younger son, who God had told her would be the stronger one and the leader of the two (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.23">25:23</a>). Rebekah helped Jacob seize the blessing of the firstborn by deceiving Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-40">27:1-40</a>). Afterward, she arranged for Jacob to be sent to Haran to get away from his brother’s resulting anger (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.41-28.5">27:41–28:5</a>). Rebekah’s deceptive scheme created a lasting schism in the family, and she apparently never saw her favorite son again. She was, however, buried with Isaac in the family burial site (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.31">49:31</a>), and she fulfilled God’s plan as the mother of Jacob, the founding father of Israel.</p>

<title>Esau</title>
<refs>Gen.25.24-34</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Esau</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Esau, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, was Jacob’s older twin brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.24-26">Gen 25:24-26</a>), so named because his body was hairy at birth. His descendants were called Edomites (“Edom” meaning “red”) on account of his reddish color at birth (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.25">25:25</a>), the red lentil stew he received from Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">25:30</a>), and the reddish color of the land in which he settled (see <a href="?item=Gen.25.25_StudyNote_Filament">study note on Gen 25:25</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Esau was a proficient hunter who brought tasty wild meat to his father. Isaac enjoyed its strong flavor more than the mild meat Jacob provided from the family flocks. One day Esau returned home very hungry from an unsuccessful hunt, and Jacob persuaded Esau to surrender his birthright in exchange for food (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.29-34">25:29-34</a>). Esau had little regard for his birthright and was controlled by his carnal desires (see <a href="?bref=Heb.12.16">Heb 12:16</a>). He also married two local women who were not Abraham’s descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.34-35">Gen 26:34-35</a>), which may have fed into Rebekah’s favoritism toward Jacob and her idea about stealing the blessing of Isaac that was intended for Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-40">27:1-40</a>). Esau’s anger on discovering his brother’s deception prompted Jacob to flee for Haran. The brothers were reunited twenty years later when Esau demonstrated gracious forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.1-16">33:1-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Esau was born with Jacob grasping his heel; this omen was interpreted to mean that Esau’s descendants would be subject to Jacob’s offspring. The subservient relationship between the Edomites and the Israelites began in David’s time (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.11-15">2 Sam 8:11-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.11-13">1 Chr 18:11-13</a>) and continued until the reign of Jehoram (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">2 Kgs 8:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.8-10">2 Chr 21:8-10</a>). Following a rebellion in 845 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Edomites briefly gained their independence but were conquered again by Amaziah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>). They regained their freedom in 735 <span class="era">BC</span> and then remained independent of Judah.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the New Testament, Esau represents the line of Abraham’s descendants who lacked the gift of faith and were rejected by God as recipients of his promised blessings (see <a href="?bref=Rom.9.6-24">Rom 9:6-24</a>). Herod the Great was an Edomite.</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Rachel, Laban’s beautiful younger daughter, was Jacob’s favorite wife. He first met her as he arrived at Paddan-aram in Haran, when he helped her remove the stone from a well and watered her father’s sheep (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.10">Gen 29:10</a>). Jacob agreed to work seven years for Laban in order to have Rachel as his wife, and the time seemed like only a few days because of his great love for her.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Laban deceptively required Jacob to marry Leah, his older, less attractive daughter, before finally giving him Rachel. Unlike Leah, Rachel was barren in the early years of her marriage to Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.31">29:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.30.1">30:1</a>). She gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob in order to have children by her, and Dan and Naphtali were born (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.3-8">30:3-8</a>). In time, Rachel conceived and bore Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.22-24">30:22-24</a>), and soon after, Jacob took his wives, children, and possessions away from Haran.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Somewhere between Bethel and Bethlehem, Rachel died while giving birth to Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.16-20">35:16-20</a>).

In Egypt, Joseph quickly rose in prominence, until he was jailed when his master’s wife falsely accused him. In prison he correctly interpreted dreams for fellow inmates and was later summoned when Pharaoh couldn’t understand his own dreams. Joseph interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams—which were about an upcoming famine—with insight and wisdom, so Pharaoh released him (thirteen years after he had been brought to Egypt as a slave) and appointed him to lead the nation in preparation for the famine. When Joseph’s brothers had to buy grain in Egypt, they appeared before him, but they did not recognize him. Later, their remorse and Judah’s intercession provoked Joseph to disclose his identity. The family was reconciled and reunited when Jacob came to live in Egypt.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Because Jacob blessed Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and took them as his own (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.5-20">48:5-20</a>), each was considered a separate tribe later in Israel. Ephraim, whom Jacob put first and to whom he gave the birthright (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.17-20">48:17-20</a>), became one of the strongest tribes of Israel and the leading tribe in the northern kingdom after the division during Rehoboam’s reign (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.26-12.33">1 Kgs 11:26–12:33</a>). Several of the prophets refer to the northern kingdom under the names Ephraim (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.15-19">Ezek 37:15-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.3-5">Hos 5:3-5</a>) and Joseph (e.g., <a href="?bref=Obad.1.18">Obad 1:18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Joseph had faith that the Israelites would someday return to the land God had promised them, so his dying wish was that his bones be buried in Canaan when they left Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.24-26">Gen 50:24-26</a>; see <a href="?bref=Exod.13.19">Exod 13:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Josh 24:32</a>). Joseph’s story dramatizes the life of a man of faith and godly character who fulfilled God’s plan. His name is mentioned frequently in Scripture, showing that he was highly regarded by later Israelites. His story is summarized in the Psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.105.16-22">Ps 105:16-22</a>) and in Stephen’s speech just prior to his martyrdom (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.9-14">Acts 7:9-14</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Joseph’s life confirms God’s control of the long course of history even when bad things happen (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.20">Gen 50:20</a>). God expresses his sovereign power through his provident, faithful love for his people. Joseph also models for us a firm faith in the sovereign God and personal integrity in the face of adversity.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Judah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Judah is remembered most often as the ancestor of King David and of Jesus Christ. Despite his birth as a middle child and his sins as an adult (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.1-30">Gen 38</a>), God chose Judah to carry the line of King David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1-17">1 Chr 2:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1-24">3:1-24</a>) and of the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.8-12">Gen 49:8-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-16">Matt 1:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.23-34">Luke 3:23-34</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Judah was the fourth of Jacob’s twelve sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.23">Gen 35:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1">1 Chr 2:1</a>). Leah, overjoyed to have borne her fourth son, named him Judah, meaning “praise” (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.35">Gen 29:35</a>). Judah fathered five sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah by Bathshua, a woman from Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.1-5">Gen 38:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.3">1 Chr 2:3</a>); and the twins, Perez and Zerah, by his daughter-in-law Tamar (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.27-30">Gen 38:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.4">1 Chr 2:4</a>). God killed his first two sons, Er and Onan, in Canaan for disobedience (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.12">Gen 46:12</a>). Judah eventually settled his family in Egypt with his father and brothers (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.1-2">Exod 1:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though reckless in his behavior with Tamar (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.6-30">Gen 38:6-30</a>), Judah took personal responsibility for Benjamin’s safety in Egypt and interceded with Joseph for his brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.44.14-34">44:14-34</a>). When Jacob gave his dying blessing, he granted Judah a position of leadership; the future kings of Israel would come through Judah’s offspring (see <a href="?bref=Gen.49.10">49:10</a>).</p>

<title>Abraham</title>
<refs>Gen.11.26-25.11</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Abraham</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">“By faith . . . Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land. . . . He went without knowing where he was going. . . . By faith . . . Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.8">Heb 11:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.11.17">17</a>). These key events in Abraham’s life illustrate the faithful obedience for which he is best known.</p>
<p class="profile-body">God called Abram from the city of Ur to become the patriarch of God’s people. Abram’s family relationships are recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.26-32">Genesis 11:26-32</a>. Terah had three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Terah left Ur with Abram, Abram’s wife Sarai, and Lot, whose father, Haran, had died. On his way to Canaan, Terah settled in the city of Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">11:31</a>). God had called Abram to a new land while he was still in Ur (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.2-4">Acts 7:2-4</a>). God told Abram, “Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father’s family, and go to the land that I will show you” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1">Gen 12:1</a>). God blessed Abram by making a covenant with him that included promises of great blessing, numerous descendants, and a new land (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">12:1-3</a>). These promises later saved Israel from destruction when they repeatedly failed to keep their covenant with God (see <a href="?bref=Lev.26.40-45">Lev 26:40-45</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abram left Haran at age seventy-five. Entering Canaan, he went first to Shechem, a Canaanite city between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. God appeared to Abram near the oak of Moreh, likely a Canaanite shrine. Abram built altars there and near Bethel (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.6-8">Gen 12:6-8</a>), proclaiming the one true God at these centers of false worship. Abram later moved to Hebron by the oaks of Mamre, again building an altar to worship God (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">13:18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When God again promised blessings to Abram in a vision (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.1">15:1</a>), Abram exclaimed that he was still childless because Sarai was barren (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.30">11:30</a>) and that Eliezer of Damascus was his heir (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2">15:2</a>). This obscure statement is clarified by the Nuzi documents, discovered at the site of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Nuzi. According to Hurrian custom, a childless couple of means could adopt an heir, often a slave who would be responsible for their burial and mourning. However, a natural son born after the slave-heir’s adoption would supplant him. Apparently Abram had adopted Eliezer in this manner, but God promised that Abram’s own son would be his heir (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.4">15:4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The hallmark of Abram’s life was that he believed the Lord, and the Lord considered him righteous because of his faith (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gen 15:6</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rom.4.3">Rom 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6">Gal 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.23">Jas 2:23</a>). Abram was declared righteous not because he was sinless. On several occasions he failed to do what was right—twice he lied about Sarai out of fear, and he took the provision of a son into his own hands with Hagar rather than continuing to wait for God to act (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-5">Gen 16:1-5</a>). But he consistently returned to faith as the fundamental principle of his life before God.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born to Sarai’s servant Hagar. When Abram was ninety-nine, the Lord appeared to him and reaffirmed his covenant promise of a son and of blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">Gen 17</a>), adding circumcision as the mark of the covenant relationship (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">17:9-14</a>). God also changed Abram’s and Sarai’s names to Abraham and Sarah (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5">17:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.17.15">15</a>). Abraham laughed at the promise of another son (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">17:17</a>). Shortly afterward, the Lord appeared again to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-15">18:1-15</a>) and again announced the promised son. This time, Sarah was caught laughing in disbelief (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.10-15">18:10-15</a>). Abraham was one hundred years old and his wife was ninety when the Lord did “exactly what he had promised” (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1">21:1</a>). The long-promised son was born and was fittingly named Isaac (“he laughs!”).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The supreme test of Abraham’s faith came when God commanded him to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-19">22:1-19</a>). Abraham obeyed faithfully, trusting that God would not thwart his own purposes (see <a href="?bref=Heb.11.17-19">Heb 11:17-19</a>). Just as the knife was about to fall, the angel of God stopped Abraham and provided a ram for him to sacrifice in Isaac’s place. Abraham’s faith was complete (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.10-13">22:10-13</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Christians understand the sacrifice of Isaac as prefiguring God’s provision of his only Son, Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. God has fulfilled his covenant with Abraham through Jesus Christ, through whom the blessing of salvation is extended to all who have faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.16-17">Rom 4:16-17</a>), making believers Abraham’s spiritual descendants (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.29">Gal 3:29</a>). Abraham’s life shows that God is faithful and worthy of belief and obedience. The full import of God’s promise was realized when the gospel was preached to all nations and people from all families of the earth responded in faith (see <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-9">Gal 3:6-9</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abraham was called God’s friend (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.7">2 Chr 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.23">Jas 2:23</a>). All who live by faith are challenged to live as he did, daily venturing into the unknown with trust in God’s guidance and sustenance. Abraham is one of many great “witnesses” to a life of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.1">Heb 12:1</a>; see <a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-40">Heb 11</a>), inspiring believers to persevere in faith because we know God is faithful.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Jacob</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jacob, the younger twin son of Isaac and Rebekah, struggled with his twin brother Esau in the womb and was born grasping Esau’s heel (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.21-26">Gen 25:21-26</a>). God told Rebekah that the boys represented two nations and that the older son would serve the younger (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.23">Gen. 25:23</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Isaac favored Esau, an outdoorsman; Rebekah preferred Jacob, who was happier at home. Once, Esau returned famished from hunting and Jacob bought his birthright with some red stew he had cooked (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.27-34">Gen 25:27-34</a>; see <a href="?bref=Heb.12.16">Heb 12:16</a>). Some time later, Isaac asked Esau to prepare wild game so he could eat and bless him (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-4">Gen 27:1-4</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.28">25:28</a>). But Rebekah sent Jacob to deceive Isaac into blessing him instead, and her ploy was successful (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.5-29">27:5-29</a>). Jacob’s ruse was soon discovered (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.30-35">27:30-35</a>), but legally, valid blessings were irrevocable promises (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.33">27:33</a>). So Isaac gave Esau a lesser blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.36-40">27:36-40</a>), and Esau plotted to kill Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.41">27:41</a>). Rebekah convinced Isaac to send Jacob away to her brother Laban so that Jacob would marry among relatives (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.42-46">27:42-46</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">So Isaac transferred the covenant promises to Jacob and sent him to Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.1-5">28:1-5</a>). Along the way, God appeared to Jacob in a dream and affirmed the promises of land and descendants that he had given to Abraham and Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.10-15">28:10-15</a>). Jacob worshiped the Lord and named the place Bethel (“house of God”).</p>
<p class="profile-body">At Haran, Jacob began to serve his uncle Laban (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-31.55">Gen 29–31</a>). Jacob loved Laban’s daughter Rachel and worked seven years to marry her, but Laban deceived him by substituting his older daughter Leah on Jacob’s wedding night. Jacob worked seven more years for Rachel and an additional six years to acquire flocks for himself (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.25-43">30:25-43</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gen.31.38-42">31:38-42</a>). Despite many hardships, he had thirteen children and became very prosperous.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After twenty years, God told Jacob to return to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.3">31:3</a>). Fearing reprisals from Laban and his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.1-2">31:1-2</a>), Jacob organized his caravan and left while Laban was away (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.4-21">31:4-21</a>). Laban gave chase, but God prevented him from harming Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.22-24">31:22-24</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.31.29">29</a>). Laban instead upbraided Jacob for leaving stealthily and for stealing his idols (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.25-30">31:25-30</a>). Jacob let Laban search his tents, but the idols were not found (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.33-35">31:33-35</a>), and Jacob became angry (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.36-42">31:36-42</a>). Though their conflict remained unresolved, the two men made a peace covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.43-54">31:43-54</a>); the location formed a lasting boundary between Israel and Aram.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jacob now faced Esau and God. When Esau came to meet him with four hundred men, Jacob sought God’s protection and sent gifts to pacify his estranged brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.3-21">32:3-21</a>). Meanwhile, that night, in an event that symbolized his whole life, Jacob wrestled with a man who dislocated his hip and gave him the blessing he sought (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.22-32">32:22-32</a>). God also changed his name to Israel (“God fights”).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the morning Jacob met Esau and the two were reconciled (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.1-11">33:1-11</a>); Esau was gracious and forgiving, and Jacob shared some of his blessing. Esau then returned to Seir while Jacob continued to Canaan. In Shechem, Jacob bought land and built an altar (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.18-20">33:18-20</a>), then moved to Bethel and expelled all foreign idols from his household (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.1-8">35:1-8</a>). God reaffirmed Jacob’s new name, Israel, and renewed his promises of land and descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.9-15">35:9-15</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jacob’s favoritism for Rachel extended to her son Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.1-3">37:1-3</a>). Joseph's brothers became filled with jealousy and hatred toward Joseph—further fueled by Joseph's dreams (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.4-11">37:4-11</a>)—and they sold him as a slave (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.12-28">37:12-28</a>). For over twenty years Jacob believed Joseph was dead. Only after letting Benjamin go to Egypt in Judah’s care did Jacob learn that Joseph was alive and would be the source of famine relief for his family (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.1-14">43:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.45.24-28">45:24-28</a>). Jacob’s spirits revived, and he moved to Egypt and joyously reunited with his favorite son at Goshen (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.28-30">46:28-30</a>), where he prospered for seventeen more years.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jacob approached death at age 147, he arranged for the future of his family. He made Joseph swear to bury him in Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.29-31">47:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.29-32">49:29-32</a>). He gave Joseph’s sons his prime blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.1-20">48:1-20</a>) and put Ephraim, the younger son, first. He gave assurance that the family would return to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.21-22">48:21-22</a>), then blessed each of his sons and prophesied the future of their descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-28">49:1-28</a>). He died and was buried at the cave of Machpelah, accompanied by his sons and a large Egyptian procession (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.33–50.13">49:33–50:13</a>). His death marked the end of the patriarchal age and the beginning of Israel’s growth as a nation in Egypt until they returned to live again in the Promised Land (see Exodus—Joshua).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The name “Jacob” became synonymous with the nation of Israel (see <a href="?bref=Num.23.7">Num 23:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.23.21">21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.5">24:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.2">Hos 12:2</a>). God called the nation to serve him as their forefathers had done (<a href="?bref=Hos.12.3-14">Hos 12:3-14</a>). He promised Israel the same love that he had shown toward Jacob (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.2">Mal 1:2</a>).

<p class="profile-title">Egypt</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Egypt was already a great and ancient civilization when Joseph rose to power (<a href="?bref=Gen.39.1-41.57">Gen 39–41</a>) and Jacob’s family traveled there for food (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.42.1-46.34">42–46</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.10-20">12:10-20</a>). Its unique location and geography gave it security from invaders (with the harborless Mediterranean Sea to the north, the rugged Sinai peninsula to the east, and a great desert to the west) and made it an attractive refuge for foreigners during times of drought.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Egypt has been called “the gift of the Nile,” and no other river has been so vital to the history of the nation through which it flows. To the Egyptians it was simply “the River.” The Nile is more than just the longest river in the world. Without its water, civilization would have been impossible in Egypt—the Nile is Egypt’s lifeblood, and the Egyptians worshiped it for the life and fertility that it provided. The river’s annual floods constantly brought new and fertile soil for crops, and its waters provided food from its abundance of fish and waterfowl as well as fresh water for drinking and cleaning. It also functioned as the main means of travel, trade, and communication. During times of drought, when the surrounding nations were in danger of famine, the Nile gave Egypt a reliable supply of fresh water. The Nile defined every aspect of life in Egypt and made Egypt what it was.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Egypt figured significantly in biblical events. Abraham lived there in a time of famine (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.10-20">Gen 12:10-20</a>). Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt and rose to a position equivalent to that of prime minister (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.1-41.57">Gen 37–41</a>). Joseph’s family then came to reside in the eastern delta region of Goshen during another time of famine (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.1-50.26">Gen 42–50</a>). Their descendants were later enslaved (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.1-22">Exod 1</a>), and God’s rescue of his people in the exodus from Egypt would become the central defining story of the Jewish people (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.1-15.27">Exod 2–15</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, during Israel’s monarchy, Egypt was continually involved in the struggle for international power (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-28">1 Kgs 14:25-28</a>). After the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, a group of Jews moved to Egypt to escape Babylon’s influence (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.6-7">Jer 43:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">At the opening of the New Testament, Egypt once again served as a refuge, this time for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus as they fled the assassination attempts of Herod the Great (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-23">Matt 2:13-23</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Aaron</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Moses’ older brother, Aaron (see <a href="?bref=Exod.6.20">Exod 6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.7.7">7:7</a>), played a crucial role in founding Israel and its institutions, particularly the priesthood. He first appears after Moses’ calling at the burning bush (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4.17">Exod 3:1–4:17</a>). Moses was reluctant to accept his divine commission, claiming that he was unfit to lead the Israelites out of Egypt because his words tended to “get tangled” (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.10">Exod 4:10</a>). Despite God’s assurances, Moses continued to object until God appointed Aaron to be Moses’ mouthpiece. Thereafter, Aaron was often at Moses’ side, speaking to the Israelite leaders and demanding that Pharaoh let the Israelites leave Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.1-5">Exod 5:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">During the Israelites’ wilderness wanderings, God appointed Aaron and his sons to be set apart and dedicated as priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.1-5">Exod 28:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.29.1-46">29:1-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.1-36">Lev 8:1-36</a>). Thus, Aaron became Israel’s first high priest. Aaron’s role as high priest was especially prominent on the annual Day of Atonement, the only day when the high priest entered the Most Holy Place to purify it from the effects of Israel’s sins (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lev 16</a>). Before the high priest could do so, however, he had to offer a sacrifice to atone for his own sins.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Aaron was an imperfect leader. While Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the law from God, Aaron helped the people make an idol (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Exod 32</a>). When Moses returned, Aaron gave poor excuses and blamed the people. This event resulted in the death of three thousand Israelites, as well as a plague.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Aaron and his sister, Miriam, once wrongly challenged Moses’ authority, resulting in a temporary state of leprosy for Miriam (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-16">Num 12</a>). Later, when other Levites challenged Aaron’s authority, God affirmed Aaron’s role by making his staff bud with almond blossoms (<a href="?bref=Num.17.1-13">Num 17</a>). However, because Moses and Aaron challenged God’s authority (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1-13">Num 20:1-13</a>), they both died in the wilderness without entering the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.20.22-29">Num 20:22-29</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jesus has become the Great High Priest, far surpassing Aaron’s priestly authority and effectiveness (see <a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-10.39">Heb 7–10</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Jethro (Reuel)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jethro, also called Reuel (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16-18">Exod 2:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Num 10:29</a>), was “the priest of Midian” (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16">Exod 2:16</a>). Moses rescued Jethro’s seven daughters from the rough treatment of other shepherds at a well and helped them water their flocks. At home they told their father of this surprising encounter with “an Egyptian.” Jethro responded gratefully by inviting Moses for a meal, and Moses proceeded to settle there. At a later point, Jethro gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.</p>
<p class="profile-body">While Moses was still living in Midian near his father-in-law, he encountered God at the burning bush (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-2">Exod 3:1-2</a>). Before leaving for Egypt, Moses asked Jethro’s permission to go; he later sent his family to stay with Jethro during the Exodus.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Moses and the Israelites were in the wilderness, Jethro returned with Moses’ family. Jethro, having heard of Yahweh’s deliverance of his people from Egypt, acknowledged him as the God of all gods. He worshiped Yahweh with a burnt offering and sacrifices, thereby identifying himself with Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.11">18:11</a>). In response, Israel’s leaders joined him for “a sacrificial meal in God’s presence” (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.12">18:12</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jethro saw that Moses was overwhelmed with caring for the vast numbers of Israelites, so he gave Moses good administrative advice about organizing the people more efficiently and about judging disputes among the people (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-23">18:13-23</a>). Moses listened to this counsel and appointed able men to assist him as leaders and judges over the people (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.24-27">18:24-27</a>). Jethro returned to Midian and seems not to have interacted further with Israel, but his son (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29-33">Num 10:29-33</a>) and other descendants later settled with the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Judg 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">4:11</a>).</p>

<title>Pharaoh</title>
<refs>Exod.1.8-22</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Pharaoh</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">“Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word meaning “great house.” It refers to the royal palace and is also used as a title for the king of Egypt. During the time of Joseph, the Israelites were looked upon favorably by the pharaoh. Joseph had interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams, leading to his promotion as second-in-command in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.1-44">Gen 41:1-44</a>). Pharaoh gave Joseph’s family the best land in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.16-20">Gen 45:16-20</a>), and the Israelites multiplied and flourished in Egypt.</p> 
<p class="profile-body">Two pharaohs appear in the book of Exodus, neither of whom had the same regard for the Hebrew people (see <a href="?bref=Exod.1.8-10">Exod 1:8-10</a>). The first was king when Moses was born. Out of fear, he ordered the murder of all Hebrew baby boys. Moses not only escaped death, but was raised by Pharaoh’s daughter in the palace! This pharaoh died after Moses had fled from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.23">Exod 2:23</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">A new pharaoh came to power, whom Moses and Aaron later confronted. This pharaoh was determined to prevent the Israelites from leaving Egypt; he remained stubborn even when confronted with God’s power. The Bible describes his hard-hearted unwillingness to change (see <a href="?bref=Exod.8.32">Exod 8:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.12">9:12</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.9.34-35">34-35</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-32">Rom 1:18-32</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">As king, the pharaoh personified the rule of the gods over Egypt, which gave him absolute authority. The plagues were God’s attacks on the false gods of Egypt (see <a href="?bref=Exod.12.12">Exod 12:12</a>). The final plague—the death of the firstborn—was an attack on Pharaoh’s household. This climactic plague convinced Pharaoh to let Israel go, but after the Israelites left, Pharaoh again changed his mind. He chased them until he had cornered them at the Red Sea. God’s rescue of the defenseless Israelites and the destruction of the powerful Egyptians at the Red Sea is among the most dramatic rescues recorded in the Old Testament. The Lord revealed himself at the Red Sea as a warrior who fought for his people (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.3">15:3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Neither of the pharaohs in Exodus is mentioned by name, probably in keeping with Egyptian practice. However, if the Exodus took place in the 1400s <span class="era">BC</span>, the Pharaoh of the Exodus might have been Thutmose III (around 1504–1450 <span class="era">BC</span>). If the Exodus occurred in the 1200s <span class="era">BC</span> (based on an alternative chronology), this pharaoh might have been Rameses II (around 1279–1213 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

<title>Moses</title>
<refs>Exod.2.1-36.7</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Moses</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Moses was the founding leader of Israel as a nation. God used Moses at a critical juncture in the history of his people. He was the prophet who received the law and mediated God’s covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.3-6">Exod 19:3-6</a>). He was also the first known writer of Scripture.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The younger brother of Miriam and Aaron, Moses was born in Egypt under dangerous circumstances (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.15-2.2">Exod 1:15–2:2</a>). The Egyptian pharaoh, fearing a rebellion, had decreed that all Hebrew boys be killed at birth. Moses’ mother, Jochebed, entrusted her infant son to God and set him afloat in the Nile in a reed basket. Pharaoh’s daughter found him and took him into the palace to raise as her own child (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.3-10">Exod 2:3-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Little is known about Moses’ upbringing. Jewish tradition holds that he received both administrative and military training in Pharaoh’s household. When he was about forty years old, he killed an Egyptian to rescue a Hebrew slave, and then he fled to Midian (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.11-15">2:11-15</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Acts.7.23-29">Acts 7:23-29</a>). There he rescued some young women who were being harassed as they watered their flocks. Their father (Jethro) invited him home. Moses married one of the women, Zipporah, and began a family as he cared for his father-in-law’s flocks.</p>
<p class="profile-body">About forty years later, God revealed himself to Moses in a burning bush and commissioned Moses to return to Egypt to rescue his people from slavery (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4:17">Exod 3:1–4:17</a>). Moses hesitated, fearful that the Israelites would not accept him as their leader. So God revealed to Moses his covenant name, Yahweh, and assigned Aaron as Moses’ spokesman.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Moses and Aaron went to Egypt and confronted Pharaoh, who stubbornly resisted Moses' demand that he free the Israelite slaves. Moses then announced a series of plagues, which eventually convinced Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave. After they had left Egypt, Pharaoh changed his mind and pursued them to the edge of the Red Sea. God enabled the Israelites to cross safely to the other side by dividing the waters; the pursuing Egyptian army was destroyed when the waters closed over them.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Moses led Israel to Mount Sinai, where he had encountered God at the burning bush. God again revealed himself to Moses on that mountain, giving him the law (including the Ten Commandments; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-23.19">Exod 20:1–23:19</a>) and directions for building the Tabernacle. But when Moses came down from the mountain, he found that the people had already deserted the true God by worshiping a gold calf (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Exod 32</a>). Moses threw down and broke the two tablets of the law and rallied the Levites to execute some of the offenders. After praying for the people, he received a new copy of the law and led the people in building the Tabernacle.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Moses led a grumbling, rebellious, and distrustful people through the wilderness. Even his own brother and sister challenged his leadership, using his marriage to a Cushite woman as an excuse (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-16">Num 12</a>). Moses responded with great humility, and God affirmed that Moses was his spokesman and confidant.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Moses was a great man, but not a perfect one. When the people stretched his patience by complaining about a lack of water, Moses failed to follow God’s instructions and struck a certain rock rather than speaking to it (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1-13">Num 20:1-13</a>). His actions failed to demonstrate God’s holiness, and by what he said, Moses implied that he had brought the water by his own power (<a href="?bref=Num.20.10">Num 20:10</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Ps.106.32-33">Ps 106:32-33</a>). As a result, God did not allow him to enter the Promised Land.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Before his death, Moses delivered a final sermon, known to us as the book of Deuteronomy. The first generation of Israelites, who had come out of Egypt, had died in the wilderness, so Moses was addressing a new generation. Moses renewed the covenant with this generation, reminded them of its terms, and encouraged them to obey it and serve the Lord alone.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After giving this sermon and before Israel entered Canaan, Moses climbed Pisgah Peak on Mount Nebo, where he died. “There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> knew face to face” (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.10">Deut 34:10</a>). Only Jesus surpassed Moses as a mediator between God and human beings (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.17-26">Acts 3:17-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.1-19">Heb 3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Moses is mentioned in the New Testament more than any other Old Testament figure, and he appeared at Jesus’ transfiguration. The New Testament emphasizes his role as lawgiver and draws from Moses’ experiences to show patterns of life under the new covenant. Like Moses, Jesus was rescued as an infant from the evil designs of a human despot (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-18">Matt 2:13-18</a>). Jesus’ proclamation of a new law in his Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">Matt 5–7</a>) parallels the giving of the law at Sinai and presents Jesus as the authoritative interpreter of God’s will.

<p class="profile-title">Eleazar</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Eleazar was the third son of Aaron, the first high priest (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23">Exod 6:23</a>). Eleazar’s two older brothers, Nadab and Abihu, offended God by offering incense in a different way than what God had commanded (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-7">Lev 10:1-7</a>). Because of their disobedience, God killed them. Since Eleazar was the next oldest son, he was now in line to succeed his father as high priest. He performed priestly duties during his father’s lifetime, and he helped his father and Moses when some Levites rebelled because they wanted equal status with Aaron’s priestly family (<a href="?bref=Num.16.36-40">Num 16:36-40</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Aaron died in the wilderness a short time before the Israelites entered the Promised Land. He was not allowed to enter because he and Moses had rebelled against God by striking the rock at Meribah (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1-13">20:1-13</a>). Before Aaron’s death, he, Moses, and Eleazar went up on Mount Hor, where Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on his son (<a href="?bref=Num.20.22-29">20:22-29</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After this, Eleazar served as high priest for the rest of his life, which included the time of Canaan’s conquest. When it was time to divide the land among the tribes, Eleazar and Joshua cast the sacred lots to determine where each tribe would settle (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.1-5">Josh 14:1-5</a>). When Eleazar died, he was succeeded by his son Phinehas, who had distinguished himself by his covenant faithfulness when Israel had turned to the gods of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">Num 25</a>). Eleazar’s descendants included Zadok, the faithful priest who replaced Abiathar (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">1 Kgs 2:26-27</a>, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.35">35</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3-8">1 Chr 6:3-8</a>, <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.50-53">50-53</a>), and Ezra, who was instrumental in reestablishing Judea after the Exile (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-5">Ezra 7:1-5</a>). In Ezekiel’s ideal temple, only the descendants of Eleazar through Zadok would be permitted to serve (<a href="?bref=Ezek.44.15">Ezek 44:15</a>).</p>

<title>Balaam</title>
<refs>Num.22.5-24.25</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Balaam</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Balaam was a diviner—a person who read signs and omens to determine the future and performed rituals to change future events (see <a href="?item=Num.22.5-6_StudyNote_Filament">study note on Num 22:5-6</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Josh.13.22">Josh 13:22</a>). He was a diviner for hire, so when Balak, king of Moab, wanted to hire him to curse Israel, he was eager to get started. Even when God told him not to go, he hoped God would change his mind because he was very interested in the money (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.15">2 Pet 2:15</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Finally, God allowed Balaam to go, but only if Balaam agreed to say what God told him to say, and only to frustrate Balak’s purposes (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.4-5">Deut 23:4-5</a>). On the road, Balaam’s donkey stopped and refused to move because the angel of the Lord was blocking the way. The donkey could see the angel, but Balaam was blind and foolish. Still, Balaam was smart enough not to curse the Israelites when God told him to bless them, and to Balak’s great frustration, that was all Balaam could do.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Recently, an inscription was found that mentions Balaam son of Beor, a diviner who had visions at night (cp. <a href="?bref=Num.22.9-12">Num 22:9-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.22.20">20</a>). The inscription was written on a plaster wall at Deir ‘Alla, eight miles east of the Jordan River, not far north of where the Hebrews were camped at the time of the Balaam incident. This nonbiblical text, dated 800–750 <span class="era">BC</span>, identifies Balaam as a “seer of the gods” and reports that the gods, whose names in the inscription are similar to <span class="ital">Shaddai</span> (“Almighty”; cp. <a href="?bref=Num.24.4">Num 24:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.24.16">16</a>), delivered a message to Balaam and announced judgment upon the world (cp. <a href="?bref=Num.24.15-25">Num 24:15-25</a>). The inscription provides rare extrabiblical evidence about a Bible character.</p>
<p class="profile-body">While Balaam’s character and motives appear somewhat mixed in <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Numbers 22–24</a>, chapter <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">25</a> describes how the men of Israel sinned by sleeping with Moabite women and worshiping their gods, which made God angry with his people. While Balaam is not mentioned here, <a href="?bref=Num.31.16">Numbers 31:16</a> names him as the originator of this plot. After his visions were finished, Balaam apparently remained in Moab and kept working the angles until he found a way to damage Israel and get the money. The Israelites killed him a short time later (<a href="?bref=Num.31.8">Num 31:8</a>). Balaam became known as a magician with bad motives (see <a href="?bref=Deut.23.4-5">Deut 23:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.22">Josh 13:22</a>), a false teacher who was only interested in pay (see <a href="?bref=Neh.13.2">Neh 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.15">2 Pet 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>), and someone who led Israel into idolatry and immorality (<a href="?bref=Num.31.16">Num 31:16</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rev.2.14">Rev 2:14</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Moab and Ammon</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Moabites were descended from Moab, the son of Lot and his oldest daughter (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.36-38">Gen 19:36-38</a>). They settled on the high plateau immediately east of the Dead Sea. Most of Moab is gently rolling tableland divided by ravines. Even at its peak, ancient Moab encompassed a relatively small territory, but its location on the King’s Highway was strategically important (see <a href="?bref=Num.21.21-22">Num 21:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.15-18">Judg 11:15-18</a>). Prior to the Israelites’ passage through the Transjordan, the Moabites were dominated by Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon (see <a href="?bref=Num.21.13">Num 21:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.21.26">26</a>). After Israel defeated Sihon, King Balak of Moab feared that Israel might conquer his land, and Moab waged war against them (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-25.3">Num 22:1–25:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.9">Josh 24:9</a>). From that time onward, Moab and Israel were often in conflict (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-30">Judg 3:12-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sam 14:47</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.2">2 Sam 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.1-27">2 Kgs 3</a>), but there were also periods of peace (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.1-2">Ruth 1:1-2</a>) between them. A Moabite woman named Ruth displayed great kindness to her tragedy-plagued Israelite mother-in-law, Naomi, and she came to be part of the family line that produced King David and Jesus.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Ammonites traced their ancestry to Ammon, son of the younger daughter of Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.36-38">Gen 19:36-38</a>). They settled in an area of the Transjordan northeast of the Dead Sea. When the Israelites arrived in the area after leaving Egypt, God instructed them not to try to occupy Ammonite territory, as it had already been given to the descendants of Lot (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.18-19">Deut 2:18-19</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.2.37">37</a>). The Ammonites helped the Moabites oppose Israel and were excluded from the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.3-6">Deut 23:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1-2">Neh 13:1-2</a>; see <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-25.3">Num 22:1–25:3</a>).

<p class="profile-title">Joshua</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Joshua, son of Nun, was Moses’ assistant and successor as Israel’s leader. Joshua brought the young nation across the Jordan River into the Promised Land of Canaan, faithfully following God’s leadership.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Before Israel reached Mount Sinai, Joshua led Israel’s warriors when Amalek attacked Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-13">Exod 17:8-13</a>). Shortly thereafter, he was among the twelve men Moses sent to scout the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.13.1-16">Num 13:1-16</a>). Against popular opinion, Joshua and Caleb urged Israel to occupy Canaan immediately (<a href="?bref=Num.13.22-14.9">Num 13:22–14:9</a>), and as a result, of the twelve spies, only they entered Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.14.30">Num 14:30</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.14.36-38">36-38</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">God directed Moses to designate Joshua as his successor (<a href="?bref=Num.27.15-23">Num 27:15-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.34.9">Deut 34:9</a>). After Moses died, Joshua led Israel across the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-18">Josh 1:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.3.1-4.24">3:1–4:24</a>) to the conquest of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-27">6:1-27</a>). When Israel suffered defeat at Ai, Joshua turned to the Lord and followed his instructions to purge Israel of sin (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">7:1-26</a>); then Israel conquered Ai (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.1-29">8:1-29</a>). Following God’s instructions to Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.29-32">Deut 11:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-28.68">27:1–28:68</a>), Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-32">Josh 8:30-32</a>) and read the blessings and curses of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.33-35">8:33-35</a>). Joshua conducted campaigns against two coalitions of Canaanite kings, a southern and a northern coalition (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-43">10:1-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-15">11:1-15</a>). Joshua’s victories in these campaigns opened the hill country to settlement by the Israelites.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After supervising the allotment of territories to the tribes of Israel, Joshua received his own portion in the land of Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.49-50">19:49-50</a>). He established the cities of refuge (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-9">20:1-9</a>) and the Levitical cities (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-45">21:1-45</a>) and released the 2½ tribes that had settled east of the Jordan River to return home (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.1-9">22:1-9</a>). As he grew old, Joshua charged Israel to remain faithful to God (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-24.28">23:1–24:28</a>). His farewell message at Shechem summarized God’s dealings with Israel and concluded with the familiar challenge, “Choose today whom you will serve. . . . But as for me and my family, we will serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.15">24:15</a>). Joshua died at the age of 110 and was buried in Timnath-serah (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.29-30">Josh 24:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.8-9">Judg 2:8-9</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Joshua demonstrated exceptional faithfulness throughout his life, except in dealing with the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">Josh 9:1-27</a>), when he neglected to consult the Lord regarding a decision. Israel served God faithfully under Joshua and the elders Joshua trained (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.31">Josh 24:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.7">Judg 2:7</a>). Stephen mentions Joshua in his martyr’s sermon (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.45">Acts 7:45</a>), and the writer of Hebrews uses Joshua’s conquest of Jericho as an illustration of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.30">Heb 11:30</a>). It is fitting that Joshua and Jesus are the same name in Hebrew: Joshua led Israel into physical salvation in Canaan; Jesus leads all who believe in him into eternal salvation.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Rahab</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Rahab, a prostitute and a woman of faith, remains enigmatic centuries after her brief appearance in Israel’s history. Because she placed her faith in Israel’s God and helped the two Israelite scouts who came to her house, her life was spared when Israel captured Jericho.</p> 
<p class="profile-body">Because Rahab’s house stood on the wall of the city, Joshua’s scouts went there when they entered Jericho. Rahab might have been an innkeeper as well as a prostitute; other documents from the Old Testament era record women innkeepers who were also prostitutes. If Rahab’s house was in fact an inn, it would have been a reasonable destination; Joshua’s scouts could hope they would not attract unwanted attention.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Rahab’s arrangement with the scouts was a stirring declaration of faith in Yahweh, Israel’s God (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.8-21">Josh 2:8-21</a>). As a Canaanite woman, Rahab would have practiced the fertility cult of Baal, god of the storm and life-giving rain, and of his consort Asherah, the mother earth goddess. Yet based on reports of Israel’s progress toward her land, Rahab recognized that Yahweh, the God of Israel, is “the supreme God of the heavens above and the earth below” (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.11">2:11</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After Joshua’s conquest of Jericho, Rahab married Salmon of the tribe of Judah; she gave birth to a son, whom they named Boaz (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.21">Ruth 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Matt 1:5</a>). Thus, Rahab was the mother-in-law of Ruth, another foreign woman adopted into Israel. Rahab was also King David’s great-great-grandmother. She is listed with Moses, David, Samson, and Samuel as an example of faith demonstrated by good deeds (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.31">Heb 11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.25">Jas 2:25</a>). She is one of five women (including Mary) mentioned in Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus, the human family tree of God’s Son (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Matt 1:5</a>). Rahab bears especially poignant witness to the breathtaking scope of God’s grace.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Caleb</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Caleb stands as an inspiring example of faith in God. He was the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.6">Josh 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.32.12">Num 32:12</a>). The Kenizzites lived in the Negev, the southern desert region of Canaan (see <a href="?bref=Gen.15.18-21">Gen 15:18-21</a>). Jephunneh apparently married into the tribe of Judah a generation before Israel left Egypt.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Caleb first appears as one of twelve spies Moses sent to scout out the land of Canaan. Upon returning, all twelve confirmed the land’s magnificence, but ten of the scouts focused on the land’s fearsome inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Num.13.31-33">Num 13:31-33</a>). Only Joshua and Caleb believed that God would enable Israel to conquer the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Num.14.6-9">Num 14:6-9</a>), advising that the Israelites immediately take the land (<a href="?bref=Num.13.30">Num 13:30</a>). Although the people wanted to stone both Caleb and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Num.14.10">Num 14:10</a>), God protected them and punished the people (<a href="?bref=Num.14.11-38">Num 14:11-38</a>). God ultimately rewarded Caleb and Joshua for their faithfulness: Among all the adults who left Egypt, they were the only ones to enter the Promised Land.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After many years in the wilderness, and after fighting many battles, Caleb received his personal inheritance in the land (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.6-15">Josh 14:6-15</a>). Caleb’s faith did not diminish in the intervening forty-five years; his testimony reveals his character and rock-solid faith in God. Although Caleb was eighty-five years old, he was still strong and able to fight. Caleb acquired Hebron, which would become his land, by driving out the giant Anakites who had terrified the earlier scouts (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.13-14">Josh 15:13-14</a>; see <a href="?bref=Num.13.28">Num 13:28</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.13.33">33</a>). Caleb’s city of Hebron, about twenty miles south of Jerusalem (not far from Kenizzite territory), later became a Levitical city of refuge (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.13">Josh 21:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.54-57">1 Chr 6:54-57</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Caleb looked beyond serious obstacles to God’s unbreakable promise that Israel would occupy Canaan. With unabated vigor, he stood ready to conquer the territory Joshua assigned him. Caleb’s staunch confidence in the reliability of God’s promises earned him an honored place among the faithful. Even when outnumbered by enemies, Caleb trusted God, and God richly rewarded him.</p>

<p class="profile-title">The Philistines</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Philistines, situated on the southeast coastal plain of the Mediterranean, were part of a larger group of maritime immigrants from the Aegean area known by the Egyptians as the “Sea Peoples.” They settled on Palestine’s lower coastal plain around 1200 <span class="era">BC</span> and established the five cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gaza, and Gath.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Far from being unsophisticated, the Philistines were politically capable and technologically advanced. They were also fierce warriors. Their advances in iron technology made them an almost invincible foe (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-22">1 Sam 13:19-22</a>). They were constant adversaries of the Israelites in the days of the judges (approximately 1350–1050 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the early united monarchy (approximately 1050–970 <span class="era">BC</span>). Saul eventually died in battle against the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-13">1 Sam 31:1-13</a>). David, however, vanquished them before becoming king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.20-30">1 Sam 18:20-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-5">23:1-5</a>) and continued to gain victory over them during his reign (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.17-25">2 Sam 5:17-25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.15">21:15-22</a>). While the Philistines never completely disappeared while Israel was a nation (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.8">2 Kgs 18:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.11">2 Chr 17:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.16-17">21:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.26.6-7">26:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.18">28:18</a>), David effectively ended this menacing threat.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In 1 Samuel, God used the Philistines to eliminate the sinful family of Eli (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.10-22">1 Sam 4:10-22</a>). The Philistines were also God’s tool for building David’s military and political career (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.32-58">1 Sam 17:32-58</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.20-30">18:20-30</a>). They distracted Saul when he was about to capture David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.26-28">1 Sam 23:26-28</a>), provided David with refuge from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.10-15">1 Sam 21:10-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.27.1-12">27:1-12</a>), prevented David from having to fight his own people (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1-11">1 Sam 29:1-11</a>), and by killing Saul and his sons (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-13">1 Sam 31:1-13</a>), opened the way for David to become king. In the end, however, the Philistines experienced God’s judgment (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.15-17">Ezek 25:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.6-8">Amos 1:6-8</a>).</p>

<refs>Judg.4.4-5.31</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Deborah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Deborah the prophet was one of the early judges of Israel, a woman of integrity and devotion to the Lord. As a prophet, she received divine revelation; as a judge, she arbitrated legal disputes. She could aptly be characterized as “a mother for Israel” (see <a href="?bref=Judg.5.7">Judg 5:7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The time period in which Deborah lived was one of increasing moral depravity, spiritual blindness, and political fragmentation. Israel was doing “evil in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight” (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1">Judg 4:1</a>), so God once again turned Israel over to an oppressor, Jabin of Canaan. And once again, Israel “cried out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> for help” (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.3">4:3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Through Deborah, God called Barak to fight against Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army. But Barak did not receive God’s call with enthusiasm and courage. Instead, he set a condition: Deborah must go with him. Deborah agreed, but with a cost: The glory for the victory would not go to Barak but to a woman. And so it happened: Barak defeated Sisera and his army, but the glory went to Jael, the woman who killed Sisera and fulfilled Deborah’s prophecy. Barak’s lack of courage and leadership contrasts with the courage and leadership of these two women. Deborah’s actions resulted in a forty-year period of peace for Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.31">5:31</a>).</p>

<title>Gideon</title>
<refs>Judg.6.11-9.57</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Gideon</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Gideon, an Israelite judge, was the son of Joash, from the tribe of Manasseh. Gideon described his clan as the least powerful in Manasseh and himself as the least important in the clan. His story tells how God can take a weak person and use them for great purposes.</p>
<p class="profile-body">At the time, Israel was being oppressed by Midian and had cried out to God for relief (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.6">Judg 6:6</a>). In response, God sent a prophet to chastise them for neglecting him and worshiping other gods. He also sent his angel to call Gideon to rescue Israel.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Gideon’s first appearance is not promising. He was threshing wheat in the bottom of a winepress because he did not want the Midianites to know what he was doing. When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon in the winepress, Gideon questioned why God had not rescued his people as at the Exodus. God said that Gideon was chosen to be Israel’s deliverer, and that God himself would be with him. Gideon was slow to believe, and he requested a sign. He brought an offering, and when the angel touched the sacrifice, fire came from the rock beneath it.</p>
<p class="profile-body">This sign gave Gideon enough faith to act locally. God told him to knock down his father’s altar to Baal, cut down the Asherah pole, and build an altar to the Lord instead. Gideon did what God had commanded, becoming a warrior for God against false gods.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Then the Spirit of God came on Gideon, and he raised an army to fight the Midianites and their allies. Gideon was still cautious, and he asked God to give him another sign to confirm his calling. He put out a fleece on two separate nights and asked God to reveal his power by having the dew settle on the fleece and/or the ground in miraculous ways. God did so and Gideon was now prepared to follow God’s plan.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Gideon had great success as an army recruiter as 32,000 men responded to his call. Yet God directed him to pare down the numbers to 300 men. Gideon led these 300 men against an overwhelming force and defeated them.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Gideon rightly resisted the people’s call to be their ruler, but then he made an ephod from the earrings of the defeated soldiers, and the ephod became an idol (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.22-27">8:22-27</a>). Gideon, weak in faith and dependent on visible signs, eventually turned away from worshiping the invisible God and worshiped idols. Israel enjoyed peace during his time, but his lack of faith bore bitter fruit after his death (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.33-9.57">8:33–9:57</a>).</p>

<title>Samson</title>
<refs>Judg.13.24-16.31</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Samson</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Samson is a prime illustration of God’s using a person for good in spite of that person’s indifference and sin. Samson was a rescuer of Israel without even trying or caring. He did not seem to care about his people, his family, or his God. All he cared about was himself. Nonetheless, God, put him in situation after situation where he brought harm to the Philistines, whom God had allowed to oppress sinful Israel.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The first example of how God used Samson occurred after he told his shocked parents that he wanted to marry a Philistine girl. Israelites were commanded not to intermarry with the people of the land (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-4">Deut 7:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.12-13">Josh 23:12-13</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-18">2 Cor 6:14-18</a>), but Samson persisted over his parents’ objections. As he was on his way to the wedding party, he scooped honey out of a dead lion he had earlier killed. Samson was born a Nazirite, and Nazirites were absolutely forbidden from touching a dead body (<a href="?bref=Num.6.1-21">Num 6:1-21</a>), but Samson didn’t care. He then made up a riddle about the lion (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.14">Judg 14:14</a>) and bet thirty young Philistine men that they could not solve his riddle. The men pestered his wife into telling them the answer. As a result, Samson became so angry that he killed thirty Philistine men and took their clothing to pay off the bet. God used the self-serving hero to “begin to rescue Israel from the Philistines” (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.5">13:5</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the final, climactic story of Samson’s life (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.4-31">16:4-31</a>), Samson’s lover, Delilah, nagged Samson until he revealed the secret of his strength and thus betrayed his Nazirite vow. She cut his hair, and the Philistines were finally able to overpower him. They blinded him, tied him up securely, and loaded him with menial work. While in captivity, Samson’s hair began to grow again. One day, when the Philistines were celebrating and making fun of him, he asked to be led to the two central pillars of their pagan temple. He then prayed to God to give him the strength to kill the Philistines and take his own life. So he pulled the temple down on the heads of about 3,000 Philistines as well as himself. Even this act, however, was not done for his people or his God, but to “pay back the Philistines for the loss of [his] two eyes” (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.28">16:28</a>). Even though it was all in God’s plan, the story of Samson makes the reader long for a better savior.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Ruth</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The story of Ruth tells of a kind and loyal woman and of the hidden providence of God, who makes all things work together for the good of those who love him (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.28">Rom 8:28</a>). This story, part of the history that leads to the Messiah himself, starts with sadness but ends happily.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ruth lived during the turbulent period of the judges. A foreigner from Moab, she married into an Israelite family from Bethlehem when that family was living in Moab. All the men of this Israelite family died in Moab, leaving behind three widows—Ruth, her mother-in-law Naomi, and her sister-in-law Orpah. When Naomi decided to return to her hometown of Bethlehem, Ruth cast her lot with her mother-in-law. Ruth’s declaration of love, loyalty, and faith in the Lord (Naomi’s God) has few equals (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.16-17">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">As Naomi had expected, the situation in Bethlehem was difficult for her and her daughter-in-law. Ruth, by her own initiative, undertook solving the problem of food for herself and Naomi through the hard and risky task of gleaning in the grain fields (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.2">2:2</a>). She acted with modesty, grace, and courtesy, but also with determination, focus, and endurance.</p>
<p class="profile-body">With Naomi’s encouragement, Ruth then took the initiative in asking Boaz, the wealthy landowner who was supporting Ruth’s gleaning, to act as the family redeemer (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.1-9">3:1-9</a>), which would include marriage. In doing this, Ruth was exercising great “family loyalty” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.10">3:10</a>); Ruth’s generous and diligent care for Naomi is a major theme throughout this little book. Boaz responded to Ruth’s proposal by calling her a “virtuous woman” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.11">3:11</a>), and she certainly embodied the characteristics of a virtuous and capable wife (cp. <a href="?bref=Pr.31.10-31">Prov 31:10-31</a>, which uses the same Hebrew phrase and is placed immediately before Ruth in the Hebrew Bible).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Boaz settled the legal matters and then married Ruth. The book ends by announcing the birth of a baby boy, Obed. With this ending we see an important purpose of the book of Ruth. Obed became the grandfather of King David. The New Testament includes Ruth as one of only five women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Matt 1:5</a>). The everyday faithfulness of Ruth had eternal significance as God worked out his purposes through her.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Eli</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Eli was Israel’s chief priest at the Tabernacle at Shiloh, Israel’s central shrine during the period of the judges. Eli apparently descended from Ithamar, Aaron’s youngest son (cp. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.27">1 Kgs 2:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.16">1 Chr 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.3">24:3</a>). Eli was sincere and devout, but he was weak in parenting his wicked sons, Hophni and Phinehas.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Eli encountered Hannah at the Tabernacle, he accused her of drunkenness as she fervently but silently asked God for a child. Upon realizing his mistake, Eli blessed Hannah, and God answered Hannah’s prayer by giving her Samuel.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Samuel “grew in favor with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and with the people” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.26">1 Sam 2:26</a>), but Eli’s sons “were scoundrels who had no respect for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12">2:12</a>). They stole from the offerings and seduced women who served at the Tabernacle. When Eli reproached them, they disregarded him. God sent a prophet to denounce Eli’s weakness and his sons’ wickedness and to announce that God would withdraw the priesthood from Eli’s family (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.27-36">2:27-36</a>). This oracle was confirmed when God spoke to Samuel one night, telling him that he would soon punish Eli’s family (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.1-14">3:1-14</a>). Shortly thereafter, Israel’s army was defeated in battle against the Philistines, the Ark of the Covenant was captured, and Eli’s sons were killed (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-11">4:1-11</a>). When Eli, who was ninety-eight years old, heard the news, he fell over backward, broke his neck, and died (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.12-18">4:12-18</a>). His daughter-in-law went into labor and died delivering Eli’s grandson, named Ichabod (“where is the glory?,” <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.19-22">4:19-22</a>) because the glory had departed from Israel.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Eli’s priestly line survived, however, until David’s reign ended. Abiathar was Eli’s last descendant to serve as chief priest. Since he supported Adonijah’s attempt to usurp David’s throne, Solomon removed Abiathar from office and replaced him with Zadok (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.27">1 Kgs 2:27</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Saul</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Saul was the first king of Israel. He was chosen by God and the people, but he failed tremendously because he lacked confidence in himself and in God. Saul was a very complex character who sometimes elicits our sympathy. He was also the source of his own problems, especially as he brought heartache and trouble into the lives of those close to him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Saul, the son of a wealthy landowner, became king unexpectedly and reluctantly. The people had requested a king to help them fight their battles, so they were happy with Saul, who was a head taller than anyone else (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.23">1 Sam 10:23</a>). Their military problems were overwhelming, however, and Saul was not a confident military leader. Had it not been for the prophet Samuel and Saul’s son Jonathan, Saul’s reign might have been marked by complete disaster.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Saul offended God by taking rash vows during wartime (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.16-46">14:16-46</a>) and wrongly performing sacrifices before battle rather than waiting for Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.7-14">13:7b-14</a>). He also failed to obey God’s instruction to destroy all the people and plunder of the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.1-35">15:1-35</a>). So God determined to remove Saul from the kingship and sent Samuel to anoint David. Soon Saul was deeply suspicious of David, his son’s best friend and his own most loyal servant. The reluctant king became a despot, clinging to power at all costs. He spent much time and effort in pursuit of David, seeking to kill him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Saul was wounded in battle against the Philistines, then fell on his own sword. His death was a result of God’s judgment. Although David had spent considerable time fleeing from Saul, he honored the first king and his son Jonathan with a moving eulogy (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.17-27">2 Sam 1:17-27</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Jonathan, the oldest son of King Saul, was in line to be the next king. Yet when God rejected Saul and chose David, Jonathan welcomed and supported David’s rise to power (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.1-4">1 Sam 18:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.1-7">19:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jonathan was a magnificent military leader. He led his father’s army to victory over the Philistine garrison at Geba (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.3-4">13:3-4</a>). In another daring move, Jonathan and his armor bearer attacked a Philistine outpost by themselves; the ensuing confusion threw the Philistine army into disarray, allowing the main Israelite army to attack and win the day (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.1-23">14:1-23</a>; see also David’s eulogy of Jonathan, <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.22">2 Sam 1:22</a>). Saul had unwisely taken an oath that no one should eat until victory had been won. Jonathan did not know of the vow and ate some honey. When he learned of Saul’s vow, Jonathan criticized it harshly, and Saul would have executed Jonathan after the battle he had helped to win if the people had not intervened.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jonathan and David met, they quickly became friends (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.1-4">1 Sam 18:1-4</a>). Jonathan expressed his deep love for David by giving him his robe, tunic, sword, bow, and belt, which may have represented Jonathan’s belief that David should be the next ruler. When Saul tried to have David killed, Jonathan interceded for David and helped him slip away unharmed.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jonathan remained with his father even after the Lord had made it clear that he had abandoned Saul. As a result, Jonathan died with Saul as they fought the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.2">31:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.10.2">1 Chr 10:2</a>). Jonathan was a virtuous, daring, and selfless man who always spoke and acted with integrity. His love and courage helped David survive the demented attacks of King Saul.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Michal</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Michal was King Saul’s younger daughter (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.49">1 Sam 14:49</a>) and David’s first wife (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.17-27">18:17-27</a>). She played a significant role in the transition from Saul’s reign to David’s.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the ancient Near East, marriages of leading families were often politically motivated. Saul baited David into a dangerous situation by promising him his older daughter, Merab, if he would fight the Philistines. As a powerful warrior, David was an emerging leader in Saul’s kingdom. The king should have been happy to have such an ally, but he soon grew jealous of David’s accomplishments and suspicious of his ambitions. Saul hoped that David would die in the attempt, but the deal fell through. Later, Saul learned that his younger daughter, Michal, loved David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.20">18:20</a>), which gave the king another opportunity to bait David into fighting the Philistines. This time David agreed. When David returned victorious, Saul could not avoid giving David his daughter in marriage. This marriage alliance helped David when he was seeking to establish his credentials with the northern tribes (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.13-16">2 Sam 3:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Michal loved David early in their relationship and even deceived her father to help David escape from a plot to kill him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.11-17">1 Sam 19:11-17</a>). After David left Saul’s court, Saul arranged another marriage for her (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.44">25:44</a>), but David later broke up that marriage to get her back (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.13-16">2 Sam 3:13-16</a>). Michal expressed contempt toward David when he danced joyfully before the Ark of the Covenant as it was being brought into Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.16-23">2 Sam 6:16-23</a>). Because of her contempt for the king, Michal was unable to bear children.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Abiathar</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Abiathar was high priest during David’s reign and into Solomon’s reign. He first encountered David before David became king. When David fled from Saul, he stopped at the city of Nob. Pretending that he was acting on Saul’s orders, David got food and supplies from the priests there. Saul discovered what had happened and was so angry that he killed all but one of the priests; only Abiathar escaped.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abiathar was among the first people from Saul’s administration to support David. His support was formidable; he represented the priesthood of Eli’s line and brought with him the holy ephod containing the Urim and Thummim (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.29-30">Exod 28:29-30</a>), which allowed him to seek God’s will for David during crises (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-12">1 Sam 23:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.7-8">30:7-8</a>). After David became king, Abiathar served as priest along with Zadok, who was not a descendant of Eli (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.8">1 Chr 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.16">18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.3">24:3</a>). Both served David well; during Absalom’s rebellion, for example, they reported to David what was happening in the capital (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.27-37">2 Sam 15:27-37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.15-16">17:15-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In David’s old age, Abiathar wrongly supported Adonijah’s attempt to become king in his father’s place; Zadok remained loyal to David and supported Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-8">1 Kgs 1:5-8</a>). As a result, once Solomon was on the throne, he removed Abiathar’s priestly authority and banished him to his estate in Anathoth (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">1 Kgs 2:26-27</a>), a village about four miles northeast of Jerusalem. Zadok became the high priest, and that role passed to Zadok’s descendants rather than to Abiathar’s. This removal fulfilled “the prophecy the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had given at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.27">1 Kgs 2:27</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.27-36">1 Sam 2:27-36</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">The Amalekites</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Amalekites were the descendants of Amalek, a grandson of Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.12">Gen 36:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.36">1 Chr 1:36</a>). They were nomadic herdsmen; their territory in the Negev ranged from south of Beersheba to the southeast as far as Elath and Ezion-geber. They undoubtedly raided westward into the coastal plain, eastward into the Arabah wastelands, and possibly into Arabia.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Amalekites were staunch enemies of Israel. Israel’s first encounter with the warriors of Amalek came at Rephidim near Sinai when they attacked Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">Exod 17:8-16</a>). In this encounter, the Amalekites were defeated by Joshua and the Israelite army. The Amalekites later rebuffed Israel’s disobedient attempt to enter the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.14.39-45">Num 14:39-45</a>). As a result of their enmity, Moses instructed Israel to destroy them (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.17-19">Deut 25:17-19</a>), but the Amalekites continued to inhabit the Negev (see <a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-14">Judg 3:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.6.33">6:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47-48">1 Sam 14:47-48</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.1-35">15:1-35</a>).

<p class="profile-title">Samuel</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Samuel lived at the end of the period of the judges and ushered in the period of kingship. He was Israel’s last judge (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.6">1 Sam 7:6</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.15-17">15-17</a>) and was essentially considered Israel’s first prophet (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.20">1 Sam 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.24">Acts 3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.20">13:20</a>). He functioned as a priest (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.18">1 Sam 2:18</a>) and was a great man of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.32">Heb 11:32</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Samuel was born in response to his mother Hannah’s prayers. Samuel’s parents traveled annually from Ramah to the sanctuary at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3">1 Sam 1:3</a>). While at the sanctuary, Hannah, who was infertile, prayed for a son and promised to dedicate him to God for full-time service (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.9-11">1 Sam 1:9-11</a>). God answered the prayer, and Samuel was born (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.19-20">1 Sam 1:19-20</a>). When Samuel was weaned, Hannah took him to serve in the sanctuary with Eli, the high priest (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.24-28">1 Sam 1:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.11">2:11</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Eli’s sons were wicked, but Samuel served the Lord, and soon it became clear that God spoke more intimately with Samuel than with Eli. God spoke to Samuel to warn Eli of the coming disaster upon his family (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.1-18">1 Sam 3:1-18</a>). This prophecy was fulfilled when the Philistines defeated Israel, killed Eli’s sons, and took the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-22">1 Sam 4:1-22</a>). Later, under Samuel’s leadership, the people repented of their sin of idolatry and succeeded in winning an important battle against the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.3-17">1 Sam 7:3-17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">But as Samuel grew older, it became obvious that he suffered from the same weakness as Eli before him. Samuel’s sons were evil (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1-3">1 Sam 8:1-3</a>), and the people did not want them to assume leadership over the nation. Instead, the people requested that Samuel appoint for them a king who could lead them in battle against their enemies (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.4-5">1 Sam 8:4-5</a>). Samuel then anointed Saul as the first king of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1-10.24">1 Sam 9:1–10:24</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The transition from the era of the judges to kingship was turbulent. As priest, Samuel prayed for the people; as prophet, he reproved Saul for impatience and disobedience (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.5-14">1 Sam 13:5-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.12-35">15:12-35</a>). When God rejected Saul as king, Samuel anointed David as God’s chosen one (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-13">1 Sam 16:1-13</a>) and protected David from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.18-24">19:18-24</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Through prayer and perseverance, Samuel was a faithful leader (<a href="?bref=Jer.15.1">Jer 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.32">Heb 11:32</a>) who cherished his people’s well-being and courageously rebuked kings and elders. He led Israel from tribal disunity to national solidarity and established the monarchy. He presumably wrote <span class="ital">The Record of Samuel the Seer</span> (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>) and defined ideal kingship (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.25">1 Sam 10:25</a>). When he died, he was mourned by all Israel. He was buried in Ramah, his hometown (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">25:1</a>).</p>

<refs>1Sam.16.11-30.31</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">David</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">David is one of the monumental figures of biblical history. His reign was a high point in God’s plan for Israel, and it had great and lasting significance.</p>
<p class="profile-body">David was born in Bethlehem as Jesse’s youngest son; his lineage is traced back to Judah (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ruth 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.3-15">1 Chr 2:3-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.3-6">Matt 1:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.31-33">Luke 3:31-33</a>). At the time of his birth, Jerusalem was occupied by the Jebusites, and large parts of the Promised Land were still occupied by foreign people, most notably the Philistines. God would use David to complete the conquest of the land.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As a youth, David was a simple shepherd, watching his father’s sheep (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.11">1 Sam 16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.14-15">17:14-15</a>). His life took an unexpected turn when the prophet Samuel came to Jesse and anointed David as the next king of Israel. However, David’s kingship was not initiated by a coup or an assassination. In fact, David became a faithful servant to King Saul. David first entered Saul’s service as a musician, playing songs that soothed Saul’s tormented soul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14-23">16:14-23</a>). This service anticipated David’s role as the composer of many of the psalms. The youthful David also helped Saul by famously defeating the Philistine champion Goliath in individual combat (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.32-51">17:32-51</a>). This victory anticipated David’s role as a victorious military leader.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Although David was loyal, Saul grew deeply suspicious of him, and David had to flee. He was able to escape with help from Saul’s own children, Jonathan and Michal. David led a virtual kingdom in exile. He had a standing army of six hundred men. The prophet Gad and the priest Abiathar were also with him, providing direction and guidance from the Lord.</p>
<p class="profile-body">God’s long-suffering patience finally ran out with Saul, and Saul died on the battlefield. Yet it was still not easy for David to establish his rule over all Israel. The tribe of Judah immediately proclaimed him its king, but at first the northern tribes chose Ishbosheth, a son of Saul, to be their leader. Ishbosheth was not a powerful or good leader; he only stayed in power because of the protection of his father’s military leader, Abner. However, Ishbosheth foolishly insulted Abner, so the general helped turn the kingdom over to David.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As king over a united Israel, David proceeded to solidify the kingdom. He and his men captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made this central city his capital. He also expelled the remaining Philistines from the land. He then brought the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem. David wanted to build a permanent temple to God in Jerusalem to replace the Tabernacle. God denied this wish, but he showed his love for David by entering into a covenant with him that established his descendants as a dynasty (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sam 7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">David’s life soon took a turn for the worse, however (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-12.31">2 Sam 11–12</a>). At a time when he probably should have been on the battlefield with his army, he was lounging around on the palace roof. He saw a beautiful woman named Bathsheba taking a bath. He wanted her, so, like a Near Eastern despot, he took her. She became pregnant, and his attempt to cover up his adultery failed. In a desperate attempt to keep things secret, he had her husband, Uriah, killed. But not even a great king like David can keep secrets from God, and God sent his prophet Nathan to confront David. David repented (see <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">Pss 32</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">51</a>), but the consequences of his actions plagued his family and the rest of his reign.</p>
<p class="profile-body">From that point on, David’s family fell apart. David’s son Amnon raped his half sister Tamar (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.1-14">2 Sam 13:1-14</a>). Her brother Absalom then murdered Amnon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.20-29">2 Sam 13:20-29</a>). Absalom later created a civil war as he tried to steal the throne from his father (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-18.33">2 Sam 15–18</a>). Another son, Adonijah, tried to take the throne from David by having himself proclaimed king while his father was still alive (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-10">1 Kgs 1:5-10</a>). But David was able to muster enough strength to ensure that Solomon would succeed him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.28-40">1 Kgs 1:28-40</a>). David died, Solomon was proclaimed king, and David’s long dynasty began (as promised in <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sam 7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">David’s successors seldom measured up. Only rarely did his descendants lead the nation to worship God faithfully; the united monarchy did not even outlive Solomon. In the centuries that followed, the descendants of David ruled only Judah in the south. Eventually, the kingdom of Judah was destroyed. Never again did a descendant of David reign as king in Israel.</p>
<p class="profile-body">What, then, of the promise to David that “your throne will be secure forever” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sam 7:16</a>)? The New Testament points to Jesus. He was the descendant of David, and God proclaimed him the Christ, or Messiah—the anointed king (see <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Matt 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.27">9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.23">12:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.47-48">Mark 10:47-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.10">11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.35-37">12:35-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.38-39">Luke 18:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.41-44">20:41-44</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.42">John 7:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">Rev 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.16">22:16</a>). The life and rule of David foreshadows the messianic reign of Jesus Christ, which will last forever (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.32-33">Luke 1:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.15">Rev 11:15</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Abner son of Ner was King Saul’s cousin as well as his general (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.49-52">1 Sam 14:49-52</a>). Saul’s armies won important battles against the Philistines under Abner’s command (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Sam 17:1-58</a>), and Abner ate at the king’s table with David and Jonathan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.24-25">1 Sam 20:24-25</a>). Yet Jonathan and David both outshone Abner in Saul’s army.</p>
<p class="profile-body">David shamed Abner on one occasion (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1-25">1 Sam 26:1-25</a>). When Saul was in pursuit of David so as to kill him, he and his troops were camped in a circle with Saul sleeping at the center and Abner beside him. Abishai and David sneaked into the camp and could have killed Saul. They took some items from beside Saul’s head; then, after retreating, David shouted to waken Saul and Abner and berated Abner for his carelessness.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After Saul and Jonathan died, Abner promoted the interests of Saul’s son Ishbosheth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-12">2 Sam 2:8-12</a>) when the tribe of Judah made David king.

Abner was then murdered by Joab in calculated revenge (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.22-30">3:22-30</a>), an evil act that David could not prevent (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.38-39">3:38-39</a>).

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Bathsheba</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Bathsheba, wife of Uriah, was the daughter of Eliam (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.3">2 Sam 11:3</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.5">1 Chr 3:5</a>) and the granddaughter of Ahithophel, the king’s adviser (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.12">2 Sam 15:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.34">23:34</a>). Her husband, Uriah, was a Hittite mercenary in King David’s service and was one of David’s mighty men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.39">23:39</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">One spring, David stayed home in Jerusalem while the army went to the battlefield (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1">11:1</a>). Resting at midday, David strolled on his roof overlooking the city and saw the beautiful Bathsheba taking a bath. He arranged for her to be brought to his private chambers. Then he had sexual relations with her, and she became pregnant (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.2-4">11:2-4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Not wanting this scandal to become public, David arranged a cover-up: He told Joab, the general, to have Uriah bring back a report from the battle lines. David hoped that Uriah would return home and sleep with Bathsheba, thus legitimizing her pregnancy. But Uriah considered himself still on active duty, so he slept at the palace gate instead (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.5-13">11:5-13</a>). When David asked him about this, he replied that he could not sleep with his wife while the Ark and the armies of Israel were on the battlefield. This answer put David in a very bad light: Uriah, who was not even an Israelite, was standing ready to return to battle by avoiding intercourse with his wife (see <a href="?bref=Lev.15.16-18">Lev 15:16-18</a>), while David was staying at home and trying to cover up adultery! Then David sent Uriah back and ordered Joab to ensure that he was killed in battle (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.14-25">2 Sam 11:14-25</a>). Uriah’s death did not keep David’s sin a secret, however. The Lord sent the prophet Nathan to confront David, and David confessed his sin and repented (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.1-14">12:1-14</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Ps 51</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Bathsheba’s baby became sick and died, as Nathan had predicted. After Bathsheba’s period of mourning, David brought her to the palace as his wife. David and Bathsheba had other children (Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon; <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.15-25">2 Sam 12:15-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.5">1 Chr 3:5</a>). The rest of David’s life is filled with intrigue among the different factions of his wives and children, culminating in David’s old age when Bathsheba sought to ensure the kingship for her son Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-53">1 Kgs 1:1-53</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, both Solomon and Bathsheba appear (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.6">Matt 1:6</a>); she is described there as “the widow of Uriah,” a reminder of the sin that brought her into David’s family and of God’s gracious favor toward her descendants.</p>

<title>Zadok</title>
<refs>2Sam.8.17</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Zadok</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Zadok was an important transitional figure in the history of Israel’s priesthood. Since he seemingly appears out of nowhere in the narrative of 2 Samuel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">8:17</a>), some scholars suggest that he was not really born into a priestly family. However, there is no reason to doubt the biblical record that he was Aaron’s descendant (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.1-15">1 Chr 6:1-15</a>, <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.50-53">50-53</a>). Zadok’s family line is traced back to Eleazar, Aaron’s son (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.4-8">1 Chr 6:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.3">24:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.2-5">Ezra 7:2-5</a>). Zadok served alongside Abiathar, a descendant of Eli. Zadok and Abiathar were priests of Israel under King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sam 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.25">20:25</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Absalom revolted against King David, both Zadok and Abiathar showed their loyalty to David by taking the Ark to him, fully prepared to share in his exile (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.24-29">15:24-29</a>). Instead, David sent them to Jerusalem as his spies.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, when David’s son Adonijah tried to seize the aged David’s throne with the support of Joab and Abiathar, Zadok wisely refrained from supporting him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-10">1 Kgs 1:5-10</a>). Abiathar was banished (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">1 Kgs 2:26-27</a>), fulfilling the prophecy that Eli’s family would be removed from the priesthood (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.27-36">1 Sam 2:27-36</a>). In this same prophecy, God said, “I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire. I will establish his family, and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.35">1 Sam 2:35</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The loyal Zadok fulfilled this prophecy and became the sole high priest under Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.35">1 Kgs 2:35</a>). Zadok’s descendants served as Israel’s priests throughout the monarchy and beyond. Azariah, chief priest during Hezekiah’s reign, was of Zadok’s line (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.10">2 Chr 31:10</a>). During the Exile, Ezekiel’s eschatological vision of the new Temple refers to Zadok’s priestly line (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.46">Ezek 40:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.19">43:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.15">44:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.11">48:11</a>). When the Jews later came under Seleucid domination in the early 100s <span class="era">BC</span>, the high priesthood, by then regarded as a political appointment, was taken away from Zadok’s descendants. As a result of Ezekiel’s prophecies, Jewish groups such as those responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls continued to await the restoration of Zadok’s line to the high priesthood. The New Testament teaches that the office of the high priest now rests on Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.11">Heb 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.12-25">10:12-25</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Abishai</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Abishai was a powerful and successful warrior and a leader in David’s army. He was David’s nephew, a son of David’s sister Zeruiah and the brother of Joab and Asahel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.13-16">1 Chr 2:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abishai was completely devoted to David and quick to suggest violence against David’s enemies. When God allowed David and Abishai to penetrate Saul’s war camp while the troops were sleeping, Abishai wanted to assassinate Saul, but David restrained him. Later, when the revolt of Absalom required that David leave Jerusalem, the king was cursed by Shimei, a member of Saul’s family, and Abishai wanted to execute Shimei (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.5-9">2 Sam 16:5-9</a>). David twice rejected that proposal (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.10-13">2 Sam 16:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.18-23">19:18-23</a>). The vengeful spirit of Abishai and his brothers also came out in an earlier conflict: After Saul’s general, Abner, killed Abishai’s brother Asahel in self-defense, Joab and Abishai took revenge by killing Abner (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.22-30">3:22-30</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Abishai was brave and very capable. He once killed three hundred soldiers in a single battle. For this, he was made leader of the Thirty, a group of especially skillful warriors surpassed only by the Three (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.20-21">1 Chr 11:20-21</a>). Abishai also won a major victory over the Edomites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.18.12-13">1 Chr 18:12-13</a>). In a battle with the Philistines, Abishai saved David’s life by killing the giant Ishbi-benob (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.15-17">2 Sam 21:15-17</a>). Abishai also led the army, and when it divided for strategic purposes, Abishai led one group while his brother Joab led the other (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-19">10:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-18">18:1-18</a>). Their military efforts were usually very successful.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though Joab’s actions eventually led to his death, we nowhere read about the same fate befalling Abishai, who, like Joab, was a violently impulsive military leader.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Joab</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Joab was David’s nephew, the son of David’s sister Zeruiah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.13-16">1 Chr 2:13-16</a>); his brothers were Abishai and Asahel. Joab became commander of David’s armies because of his bravery and military skill (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.18">2 Sam 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.16">8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1">11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.15">1 Chr 18:15</a>). As the first to attack the Jebusite city of Jerusalem, he was awarded the commander’s position (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.4-9">1 Chr 11:4-9</a>). Joab also suppressed a rebellion among the Arameans and Ammonites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-19">2 Sam 10:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.8-15">1 Chr 19:8-15</a>) and won many key battles for David against the northern army of Israel under Abner’s impressive command (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.12-32">2 Sam 2:12-32</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Joab often acted to promote what he perceived were David’s interests. For example, he colluded with David in the death of Uriah the Hittite to cover up the king’s adultery with Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-27">11:1-27</a>). He persuaded David to allow Absalom’s return to court (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.1-33">14:1-33</a>), and he tried to talk David out of taking a census that provoked God’s anger (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-9">24:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1-6">1 Chr 21:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though he was very loyal to David, Joab sometimes acted in his own interest, and sometimes he disregarded the king’s orders. When Abner killed Joab’s brother Asahel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.23">2 Sam 2:23</a>), Joab killed Abner in revenge (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.26-30">3:26-30</a>), despite Abner’s new loyalty to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.12-19">3:12-19</a>). Later, Joab killed his own cousin Amasa (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.8-10">20:8-10</a>), who commanded Absalom’s army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.25">17:25</a>), after David had appointed Amasa commander in Joab’s place (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.13">19:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.4">20:4</a>). Joab also killed Absalom against David’s direct order (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.5">18:5</a>, <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.10-17">10-17</a>). He then rebuked David for grieving Absalom’s death rather than congratulating the army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.5-7">19:5-7</a>). Joab was ruthless, and he regained the most powerful position in David’s army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.23">20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.2">24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.19">1 Kgs 1:19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Joab sealed his fate by supporting Adonijah’s bid for David’s throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-7">1 Kgs 1:5-7</a>).

<p class="profile-title">Absalom</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Absalom, son of David, was a handsome prince (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.25-26">2 Sam 14:25-26</a>). When his sister Tamar was raped by their half brother Amnon and then discarded, Absalom took her in (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.1-20">13:1-20</a>). He might have expected David to punish Amnon, but David said nothing (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.21">13:21</a>). For two years of suppressed rage and growing hatred (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.22">13:22</a>), Absalom plotted revenge. Then he murdered Amnon and fled to his grandfather, King Talmai of Geshur (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23-39">13:23-39</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After three years, Joab convinced David to bring Absalom back, but David neither punished him nor was reconciled to him. Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years with privilege and unresolved alienation. Then he insisted on seeing the king. The two met and made at least a show of reconciliation (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.28-33">14:28-33</a>). But for Absalom, the meeting might have been a maneuver toward the throne. Afterward, he put on a public-relations campaign to undermine the people’s confidence in David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-6">15:1-6</a>). Eventually, Absalom’s underhanded tactics bore the fruit he had hoped for: He launched a coup and gathered supporters in Hebron from all over Israel. By the time news of Absalom’s conspiracy reached David, the king was unable to do anything but flee Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.13-37">15:13-37</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.3.1-8">Ps 3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Absalom arrived in Jerusalem, David’s wisest adviser, Ahithophel, joined Absalom’s side and advised him to attack quickly while David was weak. But Hushai, David’s secret agent, advised him to gather more troops and attack with overwhelming force. This advice appealed to Absalom’s ego, but it was fatally wrong—as both advisers knew—to give such experienced warriors as David and his mighty men time to gather their strength, develop reconnaissance, and devise a strategy. By the time Absalom led his forces across the Jordan River to do battle in the forest of Ephraim, David and his loyal forces were well rested and under the supremely capable leadership of Joab, Abishai, and Ittai from Gath. David’s men outmaneuvered Absalom’s superior forces and routed them. Absalom himself fled on a mule, but his long hair got caught in the branches of a tree. Joab and his men came upon Absalom dangling helplessly and killed him, despite David’s command that they show him mercy (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-18">18:1-18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Absalom’s death stunned David; his grief nearly alienated those who had risked their lives to end Absalom’s treasonous uprising against his kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.33-19.8">18:33–19:8</a>). For Absalom’s part, he had good reasons to be unsatisfied with David’s rule. But rather than following his father’s example of trusting in the Lord and honoring the anointed king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.24.5-11">1 Sam 24:5-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.5-24">26:5-24</a>), Absalom instigated a rebellion that resulted in his own death.</p>

<p class="profile-body">As King David neared death, his son Adonijah made an attempt on the throne, supported by the priest Abiathar and the general Joab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-53">1 Kgs 1:1-53</a>). The kingdom had been promised to Solomon, however (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.17">1 Kgs 1:17</a>; see <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.24-25">2 Sam 12:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.4-7">1 Chr 28:4-7</a>), so Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan informed David of Adonijah’s intentions. David immediately arranged Solomon’s coronation. Then David advised Solomon to follow God faithfully (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.1-9">1 Kgs 2:1-9</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Solomon loved God and sought his help. God asked him to choose a gift, and since he chose wisdom rather than long life, riches, or fame, God gave him all of these. Solomon governed wisely (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.16-28">1 Kgs 3:16-28</a>), received worldwide respect (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.20-34">1 Kgs 4:20-34</a>), and wrote the Song of Songs, along with most of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. Rabbis said that these books came from three stages of his life: “When a man is young he composes songs; when he grows older he makes sententious remarks; and when he becomes an old man he speaks of the vanity of things” (<span class="ital">Midrash Rabbah</span>). He also built the Temple in Jerusalem and his own palace, developed trade, and increased the wealth and security of Israel. His reputation for wisdom and wealth was very great, and the queen of Sheba traveled to Jerusalem to see him for herself (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-29">1 Kgs 10:1-29</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Unfortunately, Solomon made many foreign alliances and married many foreign women, beginning with the daughter of Egypt’s pharaoh (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1">1 Kgs 3:1</a>). Solomon's foreign wives turned his heart away from God and toward idols. Later in life, the wise Solomon became extremely foolish under his wives’ influence; he worshiped false gods and oppressed his people. So God used Jeroboam to remove a large part of his kingdom.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nonetheless, the New Testament remembers Solomon’s wisdom and glory as the standard against which others are measured. Jesus is the incarnation of God’s wisdom, which far surpassed that of Solomon (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.42">Matt 12:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.31">Luke 11:31</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Jeroboam I</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jeroboam I, son of Nebat from the tribe of Ephraim, was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel (931–910 <span class="era">BC</span>). He led the northern ten tribes into the sins that brought about the destruction of the northern kingdom.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jeroboam began his political career by supervising Solomon’s labor forces in the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.26-28">1 Kgs 11:26-28</a>). Because Solomon had drifted away from the Lord, God determined to remove the ten northern tribes from the rule of David’s descendants. The prophet Ahijah told Jeroboam that the Lord had chosen him to lead those tribes and to give him a lasting dynasty if he was faithful (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-39">11:29-39</a>). Solomon apparently caught wind of what had happened and tried to kill Jeroboam, who sought refuge in Egypt (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.40">11:40</a>; cp. Saul and David, <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.5-20.42">1 Sam 18:5–20:42</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Solomon died, his son Rehoboam was immediately proclaimed king in Judah, but the northern tribes had to affirm his kingship separately. Seizing the opportunity, Jeroboam took the northern leaders to Rehoboam to seek relief from the harsh labor Solomon had forced on them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-4">1 Kgs 12:1-4</a>). Rehoboam foolishly spurned their request (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.5-14">12:5-14</a>), so the north rebelled and appointed Jeroboam as its king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.20">12:20</a>). Thus the kingdom was divided, as God had promised.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jeroboam did not remain committed to God, however. He worried that if his people went to the Temple in Jerusalem to worship, they would support the southern kingdom. He had no confidence in God to secure his reign, so he carried out his own plan to secure his people’s spiritual allegiance. He built two gold calf shrines, at the north and south of his kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.26-33">12:26-33</a>). God was displeased with these shrines and sent a prophet to condemn Jeroboam. Though Jeroboam initially responded to the prophet’s display of divine power, the calf shrines remained intact throughout the northern kingdom’s history (931–722 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jeroboam’s false religion was a key reason for the destruction of the northern kingdom in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.14-16">14:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-23">2 Kgs 17:5-23</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Because of Jeroboam’s sins, God did not give him a dynasty (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.33-34">1 Kgs 13:33-34</a>). Though Jeroboam’s son Nadab inherited the throne when his father died, he was assassinated—along with the rest of Jeroboam’s descendants—two years later by a usurper named Baasha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.20">14:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.25-31">15:25-31</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Rehoboam</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and an Ammonite woman (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.21">1 Kgs 14:21</a>), was forty-one when he became king; he reigned for seventeen years (931–913 <span class="era">BC</span>). He is remembered for instigating the split of Solomon’s kingdom and for being the first king of Judah, the southern kingdom.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Solomon died (931 <span class="era">BC</span>), Judah immediately proclaimed Rehoboam king. The ten northern tribes were hesitant to support him, demanding relief from Solomon’s harsh policies (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.4">12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.10.4">2 Chr 10:4</a>). The king’s mature advisers urged him to agree to their requests, but he rejected their advice and foolishly listened to younger advisers, who advised him to be even tougher than his father. The northern tribes rebelled and proclaimed Jeroboam, Solomon’s former labor official, as their king. Rehoboam went to war, seeking control against the north, but God sent the prophet Shemaiah to tell him this was useless since the split was God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.1-4">2 Chr 11:1-4</a>). So Rehoboam returned to Judah and fortified his boundaries (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.5-12">2 Chr 11:5-12</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jeroboam established a new apostate religion in the northern kingdom, priests and Levites streamed to the south, where they strengthened the spiritual fiber of the realm and helped to maintain Judah’s stability (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.13-17">2 Chr 11:13-17</a>). In the end, however, Rehoboam also turned to idol worship. The people of Judah built high places and pagan sanctuaries throughout the land and adopted corrupt religious practices from the heathen nations around them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.22-24">1 Kgs 14:22-24</a>). God stopped supporting Rehoboam, so he was vulnerable when King Shishak of Egypt attacked him and removed many precious items from the Temple (926/925 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-26">1 Kgs 14:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.1-5">2 Chr 12:1-5</a>). Rehoboam then replaced Solomon’s gold shields with bronze ones (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.27">1 Kgs 14:27</a>), an act that represented the loss of Judah’s glory because of false worship.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Ahab</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Ahab, Israel’s eighth king, inherited the northern kingdom from his powerful father, Omri (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.27-28">1 Kgs 16:27-28</a>), and reigned in Israel from 874 to 853 <span class="era">BC</span>. Ahab married Jezebel, daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon. Under her influence, Ahab began worshiping Baal instead of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.29-33">16:29-33</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ahab had several military successes. He achieved victories over the Arameans (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.1-34">20:1-34</a>), and in 853 <span class="era">BC</span> he led a coalition of kings against the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III and defeated him at the battle of Qarqar. However, the Old Testament reports little positive news about Ahab, who was a traitor to God. God raised up the prophet Elijah to confront Ahab, Jezebel, and their prophets and to reassert the supremacy of the true God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1-46">18:1-46</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ahab not only betrayed the Lord; he also exploited his people, as in the matter of Naboth and his vineyard (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-29">21:1-29</a>). In Israel, the people had absolute title to the land as a gift from God. When Ahab wanted to annex a vineyard from his neighbor Naboth and Naboth refused, he was frustrated. Jezebel was familiar with another type of kingship back home: When kings wanted something, they just took it. So she helped Ahab frame Naboth, who was executed on false charges. Ahab took possession of the land, but the Lord would not let him get away with it. He sent Elijah to deliver a death sentence for Ahab and his dynasty.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Then war flared up again with Aram, and Ahab enlisted Jehoshaphat, the southern king, as his ally (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.2-4">1 Kgs 22:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-3">2 Chr 18:1-3</a>). Jehoshaphat still believed in the Lord, so he talked Ahab into consulting God’s prophet Micaiah, who prophesied that this battle would end Ahab’s life (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.5-28">1 Kgs 22:5-28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.4-27">2 Chr 18:4-27</a>). Ahab tried to escape this fate by wearing ordinary armor and having Jehoshaphat wear royal battle dress as a decoy, but there is no fooling God. An archer’s shot penetrated the joint of Ahab’s armor, and he died, “just as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had promised” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.38">1 Kgs 22:38</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">1 Kgs 16:31</a>), married King Ahab of Israel, probably to confirm a political alliance between their countries. Jezebel promoted Baal worship and demanded absolute rights for the monarchy.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jezebel influenced Ahab into establishing Baal worship in Samaria and setting up an Asherah pole (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">16:30-33</a>).

<p class="profile-body">Elijah’s confrontation with Jezebel and Ahab culminated on Mount Carmel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.19-40">18:19-40</a>), where Elijah challenged Israel to follow the true God. Following a display of God’s power, the Israelites acknowledged God and helped Elijah slaughter the false prophets. When Jezebel heard this, she threatened Elijah, and he fled (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-3">19:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, Jezebel advised her husband about how to steal a vineyard from his neighbor Naboth. When Naboth wouldn’t sell it, Jezebel coldly devised a plan to falsely convict Naboth of cursing God and the king, and he was executed. Ahab seized the vineyard, but God sent Elijah to pronounce judgment on Jezebel and Ahab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.20-24">21:20-24</a>). Ahab soon died (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.29-40">22:29-40</a>), but Jezebel survived throughout her son Ahaziah’s reign.

<p class="profile-title">Elijah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Elijah from Tishbe served as prophet of Israel during the reigns of Ahab and Ahaziah (874–852 <span class="era">BC</span>). His name means “my God is Yahweh,” and his ministry involved demonstrating that the Lord is the one true God and calling Israel back to the Lord.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Under Ahab and Jezebel, Israel began worshiping Baal, a Canaanite fertility god of storm and rain, so God sent a drought upon Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>). Elijah hid until the drought ended, and he was sustained by God. During that time, he lived with a widow in Zarephath, a town in Jezebel’s home territory of Sidon. The widow’s son died, but Elijah prayed for him and he was revived (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.8-24">1 Kgs 17:8-24</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the third year of drought, Elijah challenged Baal’s prophets to a contest on Mount Carmel to demonstrate the identity of the true God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1-40">1 Kgs 18:1-40</a>). The prophets of Baal called on Baal in vain, becoming frantic to induce him to appear, while Elijah made fun of Baal. When it was Elijah’s turn, he poured water over his sacrifice and prayed a simple, powerful prayer. Fire immediately consumed the offering. In response, the people of Israel worshiped the Lord and, at Elijah’s direction, killed Baal’s prophets. Then Elijah prayed for rain, and the drought ended (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.41-46">1 Kgs 18:41-46</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Even with such tremendous displays of God’s power, Ahab and Jezebel continued to lead Israel astray. Jezebel was furious that her prophets had been killed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-2">1 Kgs 19:1-2</a>). She threatened Elijah, who fled to the desert and asked God to take his life. Instead, an angel nourished him until he reached Mount Sinai. Elijah complained that he was the only remaining prophet of the Lord and that his life was at risk. God encouraged him in a quiet voice, gave him good news, then recommissioned him for service (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.3-18">1 Kgs 19:3-18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Elijah was single-minded in his devotion to the true God. He had an assistant named Elisha whom he trained well. At the end of Elijah’s earthly existence, rather than dying, he was caught up into heaven in a chariot of fire (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.11-12">2 Kgs 2:11-12</a>). Elisha inherited Elijah’s prophetic mantle and continued the task of confronting false worship in Israel (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1-9.13">2 Kgs 2:1–9:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.14-25">13:14-25</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Old Testament closes with the expectation that Elijah would return before the day of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.5-6">Mal 4:5-6</a>), an expectation that John the Baptist fulfilled, at least in part (see <a href="?bref=Matt.11.7-14">Matt 11:7-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.10-13">17:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.17">Luke 1:17</a>).

<p class="profile-body">When the Arameans emerged into history around the time of Abraham, they were settled around the central Euphrates, from which they spread out to the east, west, and north. By around 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, Aramean tribes had spread throughout Syria and had expanded into northern Transjordan. They set up a number of powerful Aramean city-states, including Zobah and Damascus, that came into conflict with the Israelites beginning in the time of David (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3-8">2 Sam 8:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.6-25">10:6-25</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After Solomon’s death and the division of Israel into northern and southern kingdoms, Aramean Damascus became a powerful and opportunistic player in the political struggles between the two states.

Aramean Damascus continued to inflict losses on the kingdom of Israel for the next several decades (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.28-29">2 Kgs 8:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.17-18">12:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.1-7">13:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">During this period, the Aramean city-states began feeling pressure from Assyria. Damascus was first defeated by Assyria around 838 <span class="era">BC</span> and was forced to become a tribute-paying vassal of Assyria in 803 <span class="era">BC</span>. The resulting weakness of Damascus helped enable Jehoash (798–782 <span class="era">BC</span>) to defeat the Arameans and expel them from Israel’s territory around 795 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.14-25">2 Kgs 13:14-25</a>). Later, Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>) was able to force Damascus to pay tribute to him (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.28">2 Kgs 14:28</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Around 738 <span class="era">BC</span> the Arameans of Damascus joined forces with Israel to subjugate Judah. They captured much land, but their siege of Jerusalem was unsuccessful (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.5">2 Kgs 16:5</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.5">2 Chr 28:5</a>). At this time of seeming success for Damascus, the prophets Isaiah and Amos predicted the city’s doom (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.4">Isa 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-5">Amos 1:3-5</a>). But rather than trust in God, King Ahaz of Judah turned to the Assyrians for protection, who responded to his gifts by sacking Damascus and exiling its population in 733/732 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7-11">2 Kgs 16:7-11</a>). Damascus was no longer an independent city-state.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The language of the Arameans, Aramaic, eventually became the language for diplomacy and administration all over the Near East (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.26">2 Kgs 18:26</a>). During the Exile, the Jews adopted the Aramaic language; portions of Ezra and Daniel are written in Aramaic. Aramaic was the <span class="ital">lingua franca</span> from Egypt to India during the Persian period and was widely spoken in Palestine in Jesus’ day (see <a href="?bref=Mark.5.41">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.22">1 Cor 16:22</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Elisha</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Elisha the prophet was Elijah’s follower and successor in the northern kingdom of Israel during the late 800s <span class="era">BC</span>, a time when the leaders and people of the northern kingdom turned their backs on God and worshiped the Canaanite god Baal. Ahab and Jezebel were eager worshipers of this false god, as were their descendants who succeeded them on the throne. Elisha’s ministry (853–798 <span class="era">BC</span>) began as King Ahab’s reign was ending; he was an important part of God’s strategy to bring down Israel’s idol-worshiping leaders.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Elisha started his work as a disciple of Elijah and was the one God chose to take Elijah’s place (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.15-21">1 Kgs 19:15-21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1-18">2 Kgs 2:1-18</a>). After Elijah was taken into heaven, Elisha’s miracles demonstrated that God’s great power was with him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Elisha’s miracles often involved water. He purified the putrid water of a spring near Jericho (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.19-22">2 Kgs 2:19-22</a>) and caused an ax head to float (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.1-7">2 Kgs 6:1-7</a>). When King Joram’s water supply ran out in enemy territory, Elisha correctly predicted that an ample water supply would emerge (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4-20">2 Kgs 3:4-20</a>). Baal supposedly controlled water, so these signs showed that the Lord, and not Baal, was really in charge.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Elisha displayed God’s power by helping people in tangible ways. He helped a poor woman by miraculously causing her jars to fill with olive oil (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1-7">2 Kgs 4:1-7</a>). He predicted to a woman from Shunem that she would have a son, and he brought the boy back to life when he died (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.8-37">2 Kgs 4:8-37</a>). He cured an Aramean general named Naaman of leprosy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.1-19">2 Kgs 5:1-19</a>). And he provided food for people who needed it (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38-44">2 Kgs 4:38-44</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Elisha was part of God’s plan to bring judgment on the northern kingdom. He anointed both Jehu of Israel and Hazael of Aram (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.7-15">2 Kgs 8:7-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-13">9:1-13</a>), who brought a violent end to the leaders of Israel who encouraged the worship of Baal (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.15-18">1 Kgs 19:15-18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Elisha’s miracles anticipated Jesus’ ministry. Jesus also cured lepers (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-4">Matt 8:1-4</a>), raised the dead (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.21-43">Mark 5:21-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.11-17">Luke 7:11-17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.1-44">John 11:1-44</a>), and miraculously provided food (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.13-21">Matt 14:13-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.32-38">15:32-38</a>).

<refs>2Kgs.14.23-29</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Jeroboam II</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jeroboam II, son of Jehoash, reigned over Israel for 41 years (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>), longer than any other northern king. He followed the evil example of his (unrelated) namesake, Jeroboam I (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23-24">2 Kgs 14:23-24</a>). During his era the northern kingdom reached its greatest extent and experienced its greatest prosperity since Solomon (archaeological evidence from Jeroboam’s capital, Samaria, suggests the opulence of Israel’s royal house during his reign). On a human level, an explanation for Israel’s newfound prosperity was that Assyria experienced a decline in power during this time, allowing the northern kingdom to expand. The prophet Jonah, however, predicted this prosperity as the fulfillment of God’s promise (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">14:25</a>). Even though Jeroboam’s reign came after 150 years of apostasy in the northern kingdom, God still exhibited his faithful love by offering Israel his mercy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.26-27">14:26-27</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">While the reign of Jeroboam II produced great wealth, it was not accompanied by justice. The rich landowners oppressed the less wealthy and forced small landowners to migrate from their farms to the cities. There was an increase in government corruption, economic depression, and political weakness, and Israel’s spiritual state continued to degenerate. God raised up prophets to challenge the leaders and people of Israel during this time. Amos and Hosea prophesied against Israel’s vast corruption. Amos was particularly scathing in his attacks on the rich for oppressing the poor. He mentions Jeroboam’s impending death and the punishment that was coming upon Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-17">Amos 7:10-17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jeroboam II died, the northern kingdom rapidly declined. In the following years (753–722 <span class="era">BC</span>), six kings ruled in rapid succession, and most of them were assassinated. In 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, about 30 years after the end of Jeroboam II’s reign, Assyria destroyed the northern kingdom and deported its people, thus properly bringing judgment on the sins of Jeroboam II and other northern kings.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Ahaz</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Ahaz reigned in Judah during a turbulent period (743–715 <span class="era">BC</span>). His father Jotham (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.32-38">2 Kgs 15:32-38</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.27.1-9">2 Chr 27:1-9</a>) and son Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-8">2 Kgs 18:1-8</a>) were praised for their obedience to the Lord, but Ahaz was evil, even sacrificing one of his sons to false gods.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ahaz’s reign was marked with conflict. King Pekah of Israel and King Rezin of Aram (Syria) wanted him to join a coalition against Assyria, but he refused. So Pekah and Rezin turned against Judah and won substantial victories, which severely frightened Ahaz. Isaiah the prophet encouraged Ahaz to rely on the Lord, but Ahaz refused (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-25">Isa 7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Revealing his lack of trust in the true God, Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-pileser III for help (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7-9">2 Kgs 16:7-9</a>). Ahaz made Judah dangerously dependent on Assyria, and Judah effectively became a vassal state. The Assyrian king subsequently defeated the Arameans in a two-year campaign (734–732 <span class="era">BC</span>) and killed Rezin. He subdued Israel and incorporated great tracts of Pekah’s land into the Assyrian Empire (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">15:29</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ahaz became an eager servant of Assyria. He adopted many religious innovations based on Assyrian models. Ahaz visited Tiglath-pileser III in Damascus, where he saw an Assyrian altar and sent a model of it to Jerusalem, where a similar altar was built, replacing the original bronze altar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10-18">16:10-18</a>). Several other Temple alterations also indicate Ahaz’s defection from faith in the Lord.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ahaz illustrates why the people of Judah were finally exiled. He did not comport himself appropriately as a king (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">Deut 17:14-20</a>), and he did not worship the Lord. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.20">2 Kgs 16:20</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Hezekiah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Hezekiah, who reigned from 728 to 686 <span class="era">BC</span> was one of Judah’s best kings. Hezekiah’s father, Ahaz, betrayed the Lord, but Hezekiah promoted true worship of God. Reversing the damage done by Ahaz, he repaired the Temple doors, had the Levites sanctify themselves, and reinstated religious ceremonies. He brought sacrifices, restored the priestly Temple service, and invited people throughout Judah and Israel to celebrate Passover in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1-30.27">2 Chr 29–30</a>). After the celebration, he faithfully destroyed pagan worship sites.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Soon after Hezekiah started ruling, the Assyrians under Shalmaneser V and his successor Sargon II defeated the northern kingdom, deported its inhabitants, and brought in foreign residents (722 <span class="era">BC</span>). When Sargon II died in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>, his son Sennacherib came to power, triggering widespread rebellion. Hezekiah stopped paying the tribute that his father Ahaz had paid (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.7">2 Kgs 18:7</a>; see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7">16:7</a>). As a result, in 701 <span class="era">BC</span> Sennacherib invaded Judah. Hezekiah tried to appease the Assyrian ruler by sending a vast tribute payment, but the attempted return to servitude failed and the Assyrian forces threatened Jerusalem and mocked Hezekiah’s reliance on the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17-35">18:17-35</a>). Hezekiah responded with grieving and supplication. The Lord, speaking through Isaiah the prophet, assured Hezekiah that his prayers had been heard and that Sennacherib would not conquer Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.1-34">19:1-34</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Around that same time, Hezekiah became seriously ill (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.1-11">20:1-11</a>). Isaiah told him to prepare for death, but Hezekiah turned to the Lord and prayed for healing. The Lord promised him fifteen more years as well as deliverance from the Assyrians. When he had recovered, Hezekiah unwisely hosted the rebel Babylonian king Merodach-baladan in his palace, showing him the Temple treasures and seeking support from Babylon rather than the Lord. Isaiah predicted that those treasures would be carried off to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12-19">20:12-19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After the Assyrian threat in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hezekiah’s remaining years were peaceful and prosperous; he died in 686 <span class="era">BC</span> and was succeeded by his son Manasseh.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Josiah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Josiah, who reigned in Judah from 640 to 609 <span class="era">BC</span>, was a godly man, unlike his grandfather Manasseh and his father, Amon. Josiah “turned to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with all his heart and soul and strength, obeying all the laws of Moses” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.25">2 Kgs 23:25</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The kingdom of Judah was grossly idolatrous and wicked during Manasseh’s reign (697–642 <span class="era">BC</span>). Despite Manasseh’s own repentance toward the end of his reign, conditions continued to worsen under his son Amon (642–640 <span class="era">BC</span>), who was so bad that his own officials assassinated him, and the eight-year-old Josiah was placed on the throne (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.23-24">21:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1">22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.24-34.1">2 Chr 33:24–34:1</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Josiah was sixteen, he began “to seek the God of his ancestor David” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.3">2 Chr 34:3</a>). From that point on, he was dedicated to purifying the worship of the people of God. At twenty, Josiah began eradicating pagan places of worship, especially the despised pagan worship center at Bethel. Josiah fulfilled prophecy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-3">1 Kgs 13:1-3</a>) by destroying its altar and burning the bones of pagan priests to desecrate the site (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.15-18">2 Kgs 23:15-18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Josiah was twenty-six, he organized repairs to the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.3-7">22:3-7</a>). In the process, the priest Hilkiah found the Book of the Law and read it to Josiah, who was devastated by its pronouncements against apostasy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.8-20">22:8-20</a>). He then sought more fully to obey God’s instructions and to lead the people in worshiping the Lord. He celebrated Passover as the law demanded, destroyed many artifacts used in Baal and sun worship, and eliminated pagan shrines in Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.4-14">23:4-14</a>). In all this, Josiah was apparently supported by the prophets Zephaniah and Jeremiah, who spoke for God during his time.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Josiah was not sensitive to God’s voice on one significant occasion, however, and it cost him his life (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29-30">23:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.20-25">2 Chr 35:20-25</a>). In 609 <span class="era">BC</span>, Pharaoh Neco marched toward Carchemish to reinforce the Assyrian army against Babylon. Josiah delayed Neco at Megiddo, perhaps wanting to support the Babylonians. Neco insisted that the Lord wanted him to fight Babylon, but Josiah attacked him and was killed in battle. Josiah was greatly mourned by Jeremiah and the people of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.25">2 Chr 35:25</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though Josiah was faithful, the people were not; once he died, his sons and successors began to turn away from the Lord. In spite of Jeremiah’s increased efforts, the people did not repent. The turbulent years that followed Josiah’s death soon ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of its citizens to Babylon (605–586 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Assyria was a symbol of terror and tyranny in the Near East for more than three centuries.

<p class="profile-body-fl">Shalmaneser III is well known for the Battle of Qarqar (853 <span class="era">BC</span>), considered the most fully documented event from the ancient world. His invasion of Syria was repelled by a coalition that included King Ahab of Israel and several other states. It was years before Shalmaneser was able to conquer Israel and Syria.

Assyria was then in decline, and as Jonah had feared, the king and people of Nineveh listened and repented of their sins. As a result, God granted them a reprieve, which lasted some 150 years.</p>

King Menahem of Israel (752–742 <span class="era">BC</span>) paid him tribute (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19-20">2 Kgs 15:19-20</a>), as did Tyre, Byblos, and Damascus.

He also established a great library in Nineveh, which was excavated in 1860. Many tablets were found, containing a vast selection of Akkadian material.

Very little is known about Ashurbanipal’s reign after 639 <span class="era">BC</span>, since his annals do not extend beyond that year.

<p class="profile-title">Babylon</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Babylon, one of the world’s most ancient cities, was the center of the Babylonian civilization and is an enduring symbol for defiant human pride.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Babylon was founded a few generations after the Flood by Nimrod (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.8-10">Gen 10:8-10</a>), one of history’s first powerful overlords. Babylon takes its name from Babel, a word that means “gate of god” in the Babylonian language. Babylon was probably the location of the tower of Babel (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">Gen 11:1-9</a>), an early attempt by humanity to construct their own identity apart from the Creator. It was this proud civilization that Abraham and his family left when they traveled out of Ur of the Chaldeans around 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Even though Babylon was ruled by many kingdoms throughout the centuries, the city remained a cultural and religious figurehead.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Sumerian Civilization (3200–2000 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The first great civilization to flourish in Babylonia was Sumer, centered south of Babylon. The Sumerians invented cuneiform writing, which was used by Mesopotamian cultures for three thousand years.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Akkadian Empire (2334–2154 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">To the north of Babylon, Akkadian king Sargon I (2339–2279 <span class="era">BC</span>) founded the capital city of Akkad and gained political and cultural supremacy over Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire lasted for nearly two centuries.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">First Babylonian Kingdom (1900–1600 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">During the period of the Akkadian Empire, Semitic-speaking nomads from Syria called Amurru (“Amorites”), regarded as barbarians by the urbane Babylonians, began migrating into Babylonia, where they eventually established a new Babylonian kingdom under Amorite control. The sixth king of that dynasty was Hammurabi (1792–1750 <span class="era">BC</span>), who enlarged the kingdom significantly. Babylon’s glory, however, was short-lived; the kingdom shriveled under Hammurabi’s son and lasted only another century.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Assyrian Domination (900–614 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">In 851 <span class="era">BC</span> Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858–824 <span class="era">BC</span>) entered Babylon but treated the ancient city with respect and left its king on his throne as a vassal. A century and a half later (around 705 <span class="era">BC</span>), a Babylonian vassal-king named Merodach-baladan organized a revolution, and he sent ambassadors to King Hezekiah of Judah for support (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12-19">2 Kgs 20:12-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-8">Isa 39</a>). Assyria quickly crushed Merodach-baladan’s revolution, and Assyria’s domination continued for another century.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Chaldean prince Nabopolassar seized the throne of Babylon (625–605 <span class="era">BC</span>) and put an end to the Assyrian Empire. Under his son Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 <span class="era">BC</span>), Babylon was master of the Near East, a city of splendor (see <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-4.37">Dan 1–4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nebuchadnezzar was eventually succeeded by a high diplomatic official named Nabonidus (555–539 <span class="era">BC</span>), who neglected Babylon and lost its support. When Cyrus II of Persia (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>) attacked the city in October 539 <span class="era">BC</span> (see <a href="?bref=Dan.5.30-31">Dan 5:30-31</a> and <a href="?item=Dan.5.31_StudyNote_Filament">study note on Dan 5:31</a>), the city gave itself up without a battle. That surrender marked the end of independent Babylon.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Symbolic Enemy of God’s People</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">In 1 Peter and Revelation, Rome is personified as “Babylon the Great, Mother of all Prostitutes and Obscenities in the World” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.5">Rev 17:5</a>)—a dreadfully immoral center of wealth and commerce, ruling over the kings of the earth and persecuting God’s people.

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Asa</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Asa became the third king of Judah after the split of Solomon’s empire into independent kingdoms. Asa succeeded his father, Abijah, after Abijah’s brief kingship (913–910 <span class="era">BC</span>) and reigned for 41 years (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the beginning of his reign, Asa was a good king. He opposed the worship of false gods in the land, destroyed the Asherah pole that his grandmother Maacah had set up, and removed her remaining political influence (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.13">1 Kgs 15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.16">2 Chr 15:16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In these early days, God blessed Asa’s reign with military victory and peace. Asa forced out or defeated all who attempted to conquer, divide, or destroy Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.1-8">2 Chr 14:1-8</a>). Asa’s most astounding conquest was over an Ethiopian leader named Zerah, who attacked Judah with more than a million troops. Because of Asa’s obedience and faithfulness, God gave him a tremendous victory (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.9-15">14:9-15</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Unfortunately, Asa’s attitude changed toward the end of his life, and he abandoned his trust in God. Baasha, the king of the northern kingdom, attacked Judah with the support of Ben-hadad, king of Aram, and fortified the city of Ramah. Asa paid the king of Aram to change sides and support him rather than Baasha. This meant that Asa had more confidence in a foreign king than in the Lord. Worse, Asa paid Ben-hadad with gold and silver that he had earlier given to the Temple! Asa’s power play worked, and the northern kingdom of Israel had to leave Judah to stave off Ben-hadad’s threat from the north. But the prophet Hanani rebuked Asa for his disbelief in God. Infuriated, Asa had Hanani thrown into prison (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.7-10">16:7-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">For the final years of his reign, Asa became ill with a serious foot disease. “Even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s help but turned only to his physicians” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.12">16:12</a>). Even so, when Asa died he was buried with honor in the royal tombs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.14">16:14</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Jehoshaphat</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa to become the fourth king of Judah (872–848 <span class="era">BC</span>). Like Hezekiah and Josiah after him, Jehoshaphat trusted the Lord throughout his life and worked to remove most forms of pagan worship from Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.6">2 Chr 17:6</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jehoshaphat continued his father Asa’s religious reforms but reversed his foreign policy. Jehoshaphat discontinued Judah’s war with Israel over their boundaries (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.2">1 Kgs 22:2</a>) and made an alliance with Ahab. To confirm this alliance, he arranged for his son Jehoram to marry Ahab’s daughter Athaliah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-2">2 Chr 18:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.18">2 Kgs 8:18</a>) and supported the north in its wars against the Arameans and Moabites (<a href="?bref=2Chr.18.3-34">2 Chr 18:3-34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-53">1 Kgs 22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4-27">2 Kgs 3:4-27</a>). The prophet Jehu rebuked Jehoshaphat for his unwise alliance with Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.19.1-3">2 Chr 19:1-3</a>), which resulted in his son Jehoram falling under the influence of Ahab and Jezebel. Jehoram and his son Ahaziah turned Judah toward idol worship.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Yet during his reign, Jehoshaphat kept the worship of the Lord pure. He closed the temples of prostitution (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.46">1 Kgs 22:46</a>) and sent teachers of God’s law throughout the land (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.7-9">2 Chr 17:7-9</a>). He also established a system of judges and admonished them to function as the Lord’s representatives so that justice might prevail (<a href="?bref=2Chr.19.4-7">19:4-7</a>). He appointed Levites, priests, and family heads to handle cases pertaining to religious practice and to negotiate disputes among citizens (<a href="?bref=2Chr.19.8-10">19:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Before going to battle, Jehoshaphat would insist on hearing from a true prophet of the Lord. And in one of the most stirring descriptions of war in the Old Testament, Jehoshaphat preached to the army before entering a battle. As a result, God caused the armies from Ammon, Moab, and their allies to turn against each other (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.1-37">2 Chr 20</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jehoshaphat died when he was about sixty years old and was buried in Jerusalem. His son Jehoram became Judah’s next king (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.1">21:1</a>).</p>

<refs>2Chr.26.1-23</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Uzziah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Uzziah, son of Amaziah and Jecoliah, reigned over Judah for 52 years (792–740 <span class="era">BC</span>; see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.21-22">2 Kgs 14:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.1-2">15:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.26.1-3">2 Chr 26:1-3</a>). He reigned as co-regent with his father from the age of sixteen for approximately 25 years. Later, when his father was assassinated, Uzziah became the sole ruler. He served as a capable, energetic, and well-organized king who pleased the Lord through most of his reign.</p>
<p class="profile-body">During most of Uzziah’s reign, Jeroboam II ruled the northern kingdom of Israel (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>). Both kings were successful and brought a long period of prosperity to Israel and Judah. Uzziah successfully fought the Philistines, and he built many fortifications in Jerusalem and throughout Judah. He “sought guidance from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.5">2 Chr 26:5</a>), and as long as he did, the Lord blessed him in all his undertakings and he prospered.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Several prophets were active during Uzziah’s reign. Amos and Hosea both prophesied during his life (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.1">Hos 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">Amos 1:1</a>), though most of their oracles were directed toward the northern kingdom. And the prophet Isaiah received his call the year Uzziah died (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.1">Isa 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1">6:1</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Uzziah became proud of his many successes and had a sad downfall (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.16">2 Chr 26:16</a>). He took upon himself the prerogatives of a priest, entered the holy area of the Temple, and burned incense. The priests tried to stop him from this sin against the Lord, but he angrily rejected their warnings. Because of his disobedience, God struck Uzziah with leprosy and he had to live out the rest of his life in seclusion. Uzziah was buried with his forefathers, but at a distance because of his leprosy (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.23">26:23</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Manasseh</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Manasseh, the thirteenth king of Judah (697–642 <span class="era">BC</span>), had a long but notoriously wicked reign (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1-18">2 Kgs 21:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.1-9">2 Chr 33:1-9</a>)—even though his father was the godly king Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.21">2 Kgs 20:21</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In 697 <span class="era">BC</span>, Manasseh became co-ruler with his father Hezekiah at age twelve (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.1">2 Chr 33:1</a>). In 686 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hezekiah died and Manasseh became sole monarch. He reigned a total of fifty-five years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1">2 Kgs 21:1</a>), longer than any other king in Judah or Israel. Regrettably, he was the most wicked of all the kings of Judah. He rebuilt the high places for pagan worship; he encouraged the worship of Baal, the sun, the moon, and the stars; and he even burnt his son as a child sacrifice (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.2-9">2 Kgs 21:2-9</a>; see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">2 Kgs 23:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.31">Jer 7:31</a>). He allowed divination and sorcery in Judah and “murdered many innocent people until Jerusalem was filled . . . with innocent blood” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.16">2 Kgs 21:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.3-4">24:3-4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Surviving Assyrian records note that Manasseh provided men to transport timber from Lebanon to Nineveh for the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680–669 <span class="era">BC</span>), and he paid tribute to King Ashurbanipal (668–626 <span class="era">BC</span>) after an Assyrian military campaign in Egypt in 667 <span class="era">BC</span>. Manasseh served Assyria more faithfully than he served the Lord.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Because of Manasseh’s tremendous sin, God determined to “wipe away the people of Jerusalem as one wipes a dish and turns it upside down” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.13">2 Kgs 21:13</a>). However, Manasseh repented late in life. The Assyrian army captured him, put a hook through his nose, and exiled him to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.10-13">2 Chr 33:10-13</a>). There Manasseh turned to the Lord. God heard his prayers, restored him as king, and blessed the rest of his reign as Manasseh sought to restore proper worship of God alone (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.14-17">33:14-17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Sadly, Manasseh’s sins had infected the people of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.17">33:17</a>), and God did not reverse his determination to judge the kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26">2 Kgs 23:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.3-4">24:3-4</a>). This indicates just how seriously Manasseh had sinned. Even Jeremiah, one hundred years later, announced: “Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Jer.15.4">Jer 15:4</a>). The destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple and the exile of Judah’s people followed.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Manasseh died in 642 <span class="era">BC</span> at age 67, he was buried in his own garden (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.18">2 Kgs 21:18</a>), rather than with highly regarded leaders such as Jehoiada and Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.15-16">2 Chr 24:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.33">32:33</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Cyrus II, king of Persia (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>), founded the great Persian Empire. His father was king of Persia, a small nation that was subject to Media, and his mother was the daughter of the king of the Medes. Cyrus conquered the Medes in 549 <span class="era">BC</span> and combined the two nations into one. He conquered Lydia in Asia Minor in 547 <span class="era">BC</span>, then turned to the east and brought Parthia and part of India into the Persian Empire. Finally, on October 29, 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, Cyrus conquered the city of Babylon and brought Babylonia into his empire (see <a href="?bref=Dan.5.30-31">Dan 5:30-31</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After conquering Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree that allowed the Jewish people to return home and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.

<p class="profile-body">Isaiah named Cyrus as Judah’s future deliverer (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.28-45.13">Isa 44:28–45:13</a>) and even called him the Lord’s anointed (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.1">Isa 45:1</a>, Hebrew <span class="hebrew">mashiakh,</span> “messiah”).

As a scribe, Ezra was not just a copyist but a disciplined student of God’s laws (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.6">Ezra 7:6</a>) who was qualified to teach, preach, and interpret the Scriptures.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As an important official who assisted the king with Jewish affairs in the Persian Empire, Ezra visited Jerusalem around 458 <span class="era">BC</span>, bringing articles for the Temple and the mission of establishing God’s laws and the laws of Persia. One of his first reforms was to confront the sin of intermarriage with pagan neighbors (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1-10.44">9:1–10:44</a>). Later, after the city walls were rebuilt in 445 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">Neh 6:15</a>), Ezra led the community to obey God’s law more fully (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.13-15">Neh 8:13-15</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ezra honored God through his handling of finances. The Persian king trusted Ezra’s judgment and allowed him to ask for more money when needed (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.15-20">Ezra 7:15-20</a>). Ezra gave others the responsibility for financial affairs whenever he could and required strict financial integrity (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.24-30">8:24-30</a>). He identified certain financial resources as holy and belonging to God.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ezra humbled himself before God when the people began their journey (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.21-23">8:21-23</a>), when he found out about the people’s unholy marriages (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.5-15">9:5-15</a>), and when he gathered those required to divorce their pagan wives (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.6">10:6</a>). He always recognized that God’s gracious hand—not his own ability or wisdom—enabled good things to happen (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.6">7:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.9">9</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.28">28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.18">8:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.22">22</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.31">31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.9.8-9">9:8-9</a>). He studied and lived by God’s Word and taught others to follow what God revealed (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.10">7:10</a>). He was a teacher and servant-leader, not a self-important official who lorded it over other people.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ezra’s piety and dedication, demonstrated through prayer and fasting, put his reforming zeal in proper spiritual perspective. He set the pattern for life in the postexilic Jewish community, making God’s Word and worship central priorities.</p>

<title>The Medes and Persians</title>
<refs>Ezra.1.1-8</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">The Medes and Persians</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Medes (around 850–549 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The early Medes left no written records. According to an inscription from Shalmaneser III of Assyria (858–824 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Medes had settled around Ecbatana, their capital (modern Hamadan, Iran), by the mid-800s <span class="era">BC</span>. The Medes were renowned horse breeders, so Shalmaneser raided their territory to steal large herds of fine horses. The Medes were subject to the Assyrians until the late 600s, when they gained their independence as Assyria weakened.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Persians (around 700–549 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Around 700 <span class="era">BC</span>, a small kingdom of Persia was established under Achaemenes, who ruled around 700~675 <span class="era">BC</span>. His son Teispes (675~640 <span class="era">BC</span>) was under the domination of the Medes, who were gathering forces to overthrow Assyria. But trouble for the Medes later freed Teispes from their control. Cambyses (600~559 <span class="era">BC</span>), son of Cyrus I and grandson of Teispes, married the daughter of the Median king Astyages; their son was Cyrus II (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>), who ascended the throne of Persia in 559 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Medo-Persian Empire (549–331 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Cyrus II fought and defeated his grandfather, Astyages of Media, in 549 <span class="era">BC</span>. He made Ecbatana in Media his capital and set up his archives there (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.1-5">Ezra 6:1-5</a>). With a Persian father and Median mother, Cyrus II embodied the joining of Media and Persia.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Cyrus exhibited an attitude of benevolence and generosity toward defeated enemies. A capable military leader, Cyrus invaded Asia Minor and defeated Croesus, king of Lydia, and brought the Greek cities of the area into subjection. In 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, he captured Babylon with virtually no resistance and decreed that exiled peoples could return to their homelands to rebuild their temples (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The son of Cyrus, Cambyses II (529–522 <span class="era">BC</span>), conquered Egypt, but the empire nearly disintegrated when he committed suicide. Cambyses was succeeded by Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>), the son of Hystaspes, satrap of Parthia. Darius, an energetic and efficient administrator, put down internal revolts and consolidated the empire into twenty provinces, each under a satrap or “protector of the kingdom,” with inspectors (“the ears of the king”) to check on the activities of the satraps. Darius changed the principal capital of Persia to Persepolis, where a tremendous palace complex was eventually constructed. Darius was a follower of Zoroaster and a worshiper of Ahura Mazda, the principal god of Zoroastrianism, as were Xerxes and Artaxerxes after him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">During the latter part of Darius’s reign, he suffered defeat at the hands of the Greeks at Marathon (491 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Darius was succeeded by his son Khshayarsha, better known as Xerxes in Greek or as Ahasuerus in Hebrew. During his rule (486–465 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Persian fleet was defeated by the Greeks at Salamis (480 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The loss of the empire has been attributed to the cowardice of Darius III (336–330 <span class="era">BC</span>), whose armies were defeated by Alexander the Great at Issus in 333 <span class="era">BC</span> and ultimately at Gaugamela, near modern Erbil (Arbela) in 331 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Persia and the Bible</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The earliest mention of Persia in Israel’s history is in <a href="?bref=Isa.44.28-45.13">Isaiah 44:28–45:13</a>, a predictive prophecy that was given to Isaiah more than 150 years before Cyrus captured Babylon and decreed the return of the exiled Jews to Jerusalem. The rest of the biblical references to Persia occur in the later period of Old Testament history (Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther) and in the writings of the exilic and postexilic prophets (Daniel, Zephaniah, Haggai). Persia is portrayed in Scripture as a stern but usually benevolent master that generally let the Jews govern themselves and worship in their own way. Nevertheless, the fact that the postexilic community of Judea was under foreign rule was never far from their minds.</p>

<title>Nehemiah</title>
<refs>Neh.1.1-8.12</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Nehemiah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Nehemiah was a powerful leader of God’s people living in Judea following the Exile. Nehemiah improved the morale and strength of God’s people in the midst of difficulty.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Before Nehemiah returned to Judea, he was cup-bearer to Persian king Artaxerxes I (465–424 <span class="era">BC</span>). The cup-bearer brought the king his wine (tasting it first to make sure it wasn’t poisoned) and was his trusted confidant and adviser. Nehemiah heard reports about Jerusalem’s sad state and, moved with compassion, he asked the king’s permission to return to Judea to help his people. The king responded favorably and made him governor of the province of Judea for twelve years to aid his fellow Jews and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1-2.8">Neh 1:1–2:8</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nehemiah had the support of the Persian king, but he faced opposition from the inhabitants of the land. These people of mixed heritage were the ancestors of the New Testament Samaritans. Nehemiah showed great courage and skill as he successfully helped the people of Judea rebuild the walls that protected Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nehemiah had a strong personal faith, as seen by his prayers (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.4-11">Neh 1:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.4">2:4</a>) and his confidence in divine guidance and help (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.8">2:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.2.18">18</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.2.20">20</a>). He also advocated economic justice: He rebuked a few rich Judeans who were exploiting a food shortage by exacting high interest from their poorer relatives, and he provided an example of better conduct (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-19">Neh 5</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nehemiah was vitally concerned about the people’s faithfulness, and he individually confronted men who had married pagan women (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-29">13:23-29</a>). He had a strong interest in maintaining Temple worship, and he led the Jewish community to pledge support for Temple personnel and to provide offerings (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.32-39">10:32-39</a>). He also reformed Sabbath observance (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-22">13:15-22</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Although there were still problems at the end of his tenure in Jerusalem (see <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1-31">Neh 13</a>), Nehemiah was an effective leader who restored a national and religious identity to the Jewish settlers in a period of political and economic weakness.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Esther</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Esther was queen of Persia during the reign of Xerxes I (486–465 <span class="era">BC</span>). She was a woman of the <span class="ital">Diaspora</span> (“scattering”), descended from Jews who had been scattered among the nations at the time of the Exile. Her family had not returned to the land of Judah, as some Jews had (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-2.70">Ezra 1–2</a>), but had chosen to stay in the land of Persia, like many others. Noting how important her cousin Mordecai was in the Persian government makes us guess that her family had grown rich and comfortable.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Esther was an orphan and was raised by her cousin Mordecai, who became a minor official in the Persian government in Susa. She became queen after King Xerxes became displeased with Queen Vashti for refusing to attend a banquet when commanded to do so (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.11-12">Esth 1:11-12</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After Esther’s coronation, she discreetly won Xerxes’ confidence by informing him of an assassination plot (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.21-23">2:21-23</a>). This later enabled her to rescue her people from a massacre planned by Haman, a high official to the king. Through her wise advice and brave action, Esther exposed Haman, he was executed, and the Jewish people were rescued. The Jewish Festival of Purim was instituted to celebrate these events.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Xerxes I</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Xerxes I, who reigned over the Persian Empire from 486 to 465 <span class="era">BC</span>, was the son and successor of Darius I (Hystaspes). He inherited a vast empire from his father and his maternal grandfather (Cyrus II), but he was unable to govern Persia effectively due to his cruelty and instability.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Early in Xerxes’ reign, Egypt and Babylon revolted against Persian rule. Xerxes crushed the revolts and kept the tax revenues flowing, but his brutal treatment of his subjects began cementing his reputation for despotism.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the third year of his reign, Xerxes convened an assembly of his leaders to plan an invasion of Greece. (The book of Esther begins with a banquet that probably reflects that situation.) In 480 <span class="era">BC</span> the legendary but ill-fated campaign to conquer Greece began. Xerxes’ tyrannical cruelty is exemplified by two accounts that Herodotus records from this campaign. When he and his armies reached the Hellespont (the waterway connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterranean), his engineers built a bridge so his armies could cross, but a storm destroyed the bridge. Xerxes responded by beheading the engineers and whipping the water before building a stronger bridge. Later in the campaign, after he had burned Athens, his fleet was defeated at Salamis. Xerxes responded by executing the admiral of the Phoenician fleet, and the Phoenicians and Egyptians deserted him. Only the Persian fleet remained, and it was defeated by the Greeks in 479 <span class="era">BC</span>. Xerxes was forced to retreat. Afterward, Xerxes turned his attention to matters at home, such as massive building projects at Susa and Persepolis, and the events recorded in Esther.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Xerxes had reason to worry that assassins would try to kill him. According to <a href="?bref=Esth.2.21-23">Esther 2:21-23</a>, Mordecai thwarted an assassination plot, which later led to Xerxes publicly honoring Mordecai. After Xerxes was again defeated by the Greeks at the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 <span class="era">BC</span> and stripped of territory, another assassination plot by his court officials succeeded, and his reign ended ignominiously in 465 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">The book of Job includes “the satan” among the heavenly court (<a href="?bref=Job.1.6">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.1">2:1</a>). The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">satan</span> refers to an adversary or an accuser in court (see <a href="?bref=Job.1.1-2.13">Job 1–2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.1">Zech 3:1</a>). God sometimes appoints angels as adversaries for righteous judgment and opposition to evildoers (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.22.22">Num 22:22</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.22.32">32</a>, where the term <span class="hebrew">satan</span> is often translated “block”; see also <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19-23">1 Kgs 22:19-23</a>). The Old Testament hints at the accuser’s demonic character, but it was between the times of the Old Testament and the New Testament that Satan became identified with the serpent in Eden (see <span class="ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span> 2:24).

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Jeremiah</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jeremiah, a prophet in Jerusalem before its destruction in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, is sometimes called the “weeping prophet” because he shared his personal struggles and sorrows as he delivered God’s messages.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jeremiah was born in Anathoth, near Jerusalem, during Manasseh’s reign. His father was Hilkiah of Benjamin. Jeremiah received his calling as a prophet during the thirteenth year of Josiah’s reign (627 <span class="era">BC</span>). At first, Jeremiah retreated from his call (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.6">Jer 1:6</a>), but God assured Jeremiah that he would tell him what to say and would guide and protect him despite opposition (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.7-8">Jer 1:7-8</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.1.18-19">18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jeremiah warned the kings and people of Judah to repent in order to avoid exile. They had broken God’s covenant, primarily through idolatry (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.1-16">Jer 10:1-16</a>), and as a result, they were subject to the consequences (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-28.68">Deut 27–28</a>). They rejected God’s invitation to repent, so Jeremiah later delivered messages that God’s judgment had become inevitable.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jeremiah was particularly hated by Judah’s leaders. King Jehoiakim held Jeremiah in contempt and tried to silence him. King Zedekiah secretly sought Jeremiah’s advice, but bowed to his administrators when they wanted to silence the prophet. God’s word could not be silenced, however. The promised judgment came in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>: Jerusalem was sacked, the Temple was destroyed, and Judah’s leaders were killed or exiled to Babylon.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, knew of Jeremiah and was favorably disposed toward him (<a href="?bref=Jer.39.11-12">Jer 39:11-12</a>). As a result, the captain of the Babylonian army allowed Jeremiah to stay with the remnant in Judah. Jeremiah counseled those who remained behind to submit to Babylon, even when Judean terrorists killed Gedaliah, the governor appointed by Babylon. The Judeans rejected Jeremiah’s advice and fled to Egypt. Jeremiah was taken with them, and little more is ever heard about Jeremiah. According to tradition, he was stoned to death by Jewish exiles in Tahpanhes, Egypt.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jeremiah suffered continual rejection, imprisonment, and physical abuse during his life, but his ministry was not entirely negative. He foretold that the Exile would be temporary (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.1-14">25:1-14</a>) and that God would establish a new covenant with his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">31:31-34</a>). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Luke 22:20</a>).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Baruch</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Baruch the son of Neriah was a royal scribe in Jerusalem who served as secretary for Jeremiah the prophet. His brother Seraiah was a “staff officer” in Zedekiah’s administration (<a href="?bref=Jer.51.59-64">Jer 51:59-64</a>). Baruch’s family evidently ranked highly in the administration of Judah.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim of Judah (605 <span class="era">BC</span>), God instructed Jeremiah to record the messages he had given to Israel, Judah, and the other nations (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-3">36:1-3</a>). Jeremiah sent for Baruch, who wrote the prophecies down (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.4">36:4</a>) and read the words to the people (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.8-19">36:8-19</a>). When the message reached Jehoiakim, he destroyed the scroll and called for Baruch’s and Jeremiah’s arrest (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.21-26">36:21-26</a>). But they had gone into hiding, where Jeremiah repeated the prophecies and Baruch again wrote them down (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.27-32">36:27-32</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">At about that time, God gave Baruch a personal message through Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.45.1-5">Jer 45</a>). Baruch might have been troubled about the loss of career prospects or personal comfort resulting from his association with Jeremiah. God comforted Baruch with an assurance of protection and instructed him not to seek “great things” for himself, because the promise of Judah’s destruction was certain.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jerusalem was destroyed in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, Baruch stayed with Jeremiah and the others who remained in the land. Apparently Baruch was viewed as influential: The rebel leaders wanted to go to Egypt and when Jeremiah warned them against it (<a href="?bref=Jer.42.1-22">Jer 42</a>), they accused Baruch of persuading Jeremiah. The leaders did not listen but took Baruch and Jeremiah with them to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.1-7">43:1-7</a>). We do not know how, when, or where Baruch died. One tradition records that he was taken to Babylon when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt. It is also possible that Baruch died in Egypt.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Although God warned Baruch not to pursue great things, and he seemed to die without honor, his legacy might in fact be the book of Jeremiah, which he clearly had a hand in producing—a book that warns of judgment and eloquently expresses the hope for the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">31:31-34</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In 1975, a clay impression (<span class="ital">bulla</span>) formed from a scribe’s seal was found with the words “[Belonging to] Berechiahu, son of Neriahu, the scribe” (<span class="ital">Berechiahu</span> is the long form of the name <span class="ital">Baruch</span>). Each scribe and government official had a unique seal bearing his name, with which he would seal documents to verify their authenticity—the ancient equivalent of a signature. The seal would be pressed into soft clay to form an impression (<span class="ital">bulla</span>), which was affixed to the signed document. The <span class="ital">bulla</span> of Baruch dates from the time of Jeremiah and Baruch; other <span class="ital">bullae</span> that were found include the names of several other individuals in Jeremiah (e.g., “Gemariah, son of Shaphan,” <a href="?bref=Jer.36.10-12">36:10-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.36.25">25</a>; Ishmael, <a href="?bref=Jer.40.7-41.10">40:7–41:10</a>). Most scholars have concluded that the Baruch <span class="ital">bulla</span> was in fact formed by the seal of Baruch, Jeremiah’s scribe. These <span class="ital">bullae,</span> seemingly insignificant artifacts of an ancient civilization, provide independent historical verification of some of the details of Jeremiah’s account.</p>

<title>Ezekiel</title>
<refs>Ezek.1.1-48.35</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Ezekiel</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Ezekiel, a priest and prophet, was born around 623 <span class="era">BC</span>. He was probably raised in Jerusalem, and he was married (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.16-18">24:16-18</a>). He went into exile in Babylon with Jehoiachin in 597 <span class="era">BC</span>, where he lived by the Kebar River. He was called to be a prophet in Babylon on July 31, 593 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1">1:1</a>). All that we know of his personal life is from the book named after him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Ezekiel often reinforced his prophetic words with strange actions, such as illustrating his message about the dire lack of food in the final siege of Jerusalem by eating food cooked over dung (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.12">4:12</a>). Another time, he lay motionless for 430 days, one day for each year of Israel’s and Judah’s sin (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.4-7">4:4-7</a>). When Ezekiel’s wife died suddenly, he was forbidden to mourn her in public (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.16-18">24:16-18</a>); her death was a solemn warning of what would happen in Judah (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.15-27">24:15-27</a>). Ezekiel’s strange actions were designed to grab people’s attention.</p>
<p class="profile-body">At first, Ezekiel’s messages were rejected, but his prophecies were later vindicated as they began to come true and the nation was purged of idolatry. His teaching emphasized holiness, purity, resurrection, and the ritual law. His message of hope encouraged the exiles to remain faithful during the dark hours of their captivity, and after their return it kept them looking toward a greater fulfillment.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The circumstances of Ezekiel’s death are unknown, and he is not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament. The New Testament has over sixty references to Ezekiel’s prophecies, mostly in the book of Revelation. Ezekiel’s prophetic vision extended beyond his immediate future to the final judgment and the great hope of heaven.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Daniel</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Daniel provides a stirring example of faith, wisdom, and endurance under difficulty and oppression. His life and prophecies affirm that God is in control and will have the final victory despite apparently dominant evil forces.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Daniel was a young man of Judah’s royal family when the Babylonian army first attacked Jerusalem in 605 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.3">Dan 1:3</a>). Daniel was deported to Babylon with Azariah, Hananiah, and Mishael. King Nebuchadnezzar trained these young men, among others, to serve in his growing empire. Daniel and his friends were the brightest and healthiest of the students, so they assumed important positions in Nebuchadnezzar’s court.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Daniel’s court career lasted nearly seventy years (see <a href="?bref=Dan.1.21">Dan 1:21</a>). He quickly established a reputation for intelligence and absolute fidelity to God. When Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream, God revealed its meaning to Daniel, who explained it to the king (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">Dan 2</a>). Later, Daniel interpreted a second dream about the king’s pride (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.1-37">Dan 4</a>). Daniel urged Nebuchadnezzar to repent, but he did not. As a result, Nebuchadnezzar became temporarily deranged (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.28-37">Dan 4:28-37</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Daniel always treated the Babylonian king respectfully, and Nebuchadnezzar had high regard for Daniel, whose character and behavior led Nebuchadnezzar to worship the Lord (though not exclusively). Daniel’s faithfulness and prudence encourage later readers in similarly hostile cultures.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, Belshazzar, vice-regent of Babylon, profaned the sacred vessels from the Jerusalem Temple during a banquet (539 <span class="era">BC</span>). A disembodied hand suddenly wrote the words “<span class="sc">Mene</span>, <span class="sc">Mene</span>, <span class="sc">Tekel</span>, and <span class="sc">Parsin</span>” on the palace wall, which Daniel interpreted as forecasting Babylon’s imminent end. That same night, Belshazzar was killed by Persians who captured the capital (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.1-31">Dan 5:1-31</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Under Darius the Mede (539 <span class="era">BC</span>), Daniel became an administrator of the realm (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.2">Dan 6:2</a>). Daniel’s capable management infuriated political enemies, who persuaded Darius to pass a decree forbidding worship of anyone but the king, under penalty of being cast into a lions’ den. To preserve his religious integrity, Daniel violated the law, but he was miraculously unscathed by the lions. Thereafter he was restored to his office (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.17-28">Dan 6:17-28</a>). Daniel’s later visions date from around this time (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.1">Dan 10:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Dan.10.4">4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Daniel’s prophecies are difficult to understand in detail, but their message is clear: Evil forces are now in power, but God is in control and will save his people. Jesus and New Testament authors cited Daniel, often using his imagery when speaking of the end times (e.g., cp. <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-9">Dan 7:1-9</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-10">Rev 13:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">Dan 7:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.1.7">Rev 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.27">Dan 9:27</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.24.15">Matt 24:15</a>). Daniel had no doubt that God Most High would be victorious.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Nebuchadnezzar II</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">King Nebuchadnezzar II reigned over Babylon from 605 to 562 <span class="era">BC</span>. He secured and extended the empire of his father, Nabopolassar (626–605 <span class="era">BC</span>). Beyond the scriptural record, many ancient Babylonian documents report Nebuchadnezzar’s accomplishments.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In 626 <span class="era">BC</span>, Babylon, like Judah, was under the domination of Assyria, but in that year Nabopolassar began a revolt that would change the world. In 612 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Babylonians captured Nineveh, Assyria’s capital, and again defeated the Assyrians at Haran in 609 <span class="era">BC</span>. By the time of this battle, Nabopolassar’s son Nebuchadnezzar played a leading role in the army. In 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, Nebuchadnezzar defeated the remnant of the Assyrian army at Carchemish; this victory also pushed the Egyptians back within their borders. In the same year, Nabopolassar died and his son became king.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Following his victory at Carchemish in 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Syria and surrounding areas, including Judah. In that year, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem for the first time (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1">2 Kgs 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>). He took away a number of the Temple vessels and some of the leading young citizens of Judah, including Daniel and his three friends. Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem again in 597 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.10-17">2 Kgs 24:10-17</a>). He later besieged Jerusalem in 588 <span class="era">BC</span> and destroyed the city and Temple in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, exiling most of the remaining people (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-21">2 Kgs 25:1-21</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">A detailed and interesting personal description of Nebuchadnezzar is found in Daniel. He brought Daniel and his friends to Babylon in order to educate them in the ways of Babylonia, but God used Daniel to teach Nebuchadnezzar about himself. After being humbled for his great pride (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.28-33">Dan 4:28-33</a>), Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged the Lord’s sovereignty and power (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.34-37">4:34-37</a>), though he probably never worshiped the true God exclusively.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">The Son of Man</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Hebrew and Aramaic idiom “son of man” simply means “human being.” But the majestic yet humble figure in <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, who is “like a son of man”—meaning that he looked like a man—also appears to be much more. His exact identity is not specified, but his role is clear: The Most High has appointed him to rule an eternal, universal kingdom that will be over all other nations. He also represents his own people, the holy people of the Most High. They will also share in this son of man’s kingdom over all peoples and nations (see <a href="?bref=Dan.7.22">7:22</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The scene surrounding this son of man indicates his divine characteristics. That he comes “with the clouds of heaven” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">7:13</a>) indicates his heavenly origin (cp. <a href="?bref=Ps.68.4">Ps 68:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.2">97:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.1.3">Nah 1:3</a>). The Lord God covered himself with a cloud in the book of Exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.9">Exod 19:9</a>). God’s people will be caught up into the clouds (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.17">1 Thes 4:17</a>) when Jesus returns as he was received into a cloud at his ascension (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.9">Acts 1:9</a>). This son of man receives his kingdom with humility and holiness, not arrogantly grasping after it. He is thus opposite in character to the “little horn” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.8">Dan 7:8</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jesus identifies himself with this Son of Man (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Matt 24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.24">26:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mark 13:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.27">Luke 21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.34">John 12:34</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.7.56">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.6">Heb 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.13">Rev 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.14">14:14</a>). <a href="?bref=Rev.1.7">Revelation 1:7</a> likewise yokes this figure with Jesus Christ, the one who was pierced for our sins. God the Father has given Jesus all authority and power to rule over all things (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.14">Dan 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.18">Matt 28:18</a>) and to win people from all the nations and kingdoms of the world (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19-20">Matt 28:19-20</a>). God’s purpose in calling Abraham was to make a great nation through his people and to bless all nations through him (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gen 12:1-3</a>). Jesus fulfilled this promise.</p>

<p class="profile-title">The Greeks</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Greek civilization played a major role in the ancient world, and Greek culture was a primary influence on the world into which Jesus was born and in which the New Testament was written.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Mycenaean Civilization (1450–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Mycenaeans lived during the “heroic age” that Greeks later immortalized in the epics of Homer. Their civilization was centered at Mycenae, about thirty miles south of the site of Corinth. The Mycenaeans traded extensively and were successful in war. The Greek gods and myths familiar from later literature have their roots in Mycenaean Greece. Mycenaean documents were written in Linear B, a syllabic script.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Mycenaean civilization ended violently around 1200 <span class="era">BC</span> at the hands of Dorian Greek invaders. The several hundred years which followed have been called the “Greek Dark Ages”—Linear B usage ceased, and there are no written records.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Archaic Age, City-States (850–546 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Eventually Greek towns and villages began organizing into city-states that controlled entire areas. This era also saw a rise of cooperation and a shared sense of identity among the Greeks; for example, the first Olympic games were held in 776 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As trade with the surrounding world increased, the Greeks made contact with the Phoenicians and adopted their script. Homer wrote the <span class="ital">Iliad</span> and <span class="ital">Odyssey,</span> chronicling the shared memories and myths of the earlier Mycenaean civilization and their gods.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Many of the city-states looked to a dictator (Greek <span class="ital">tyrannos,</span> “tyrant”) to provide political stability. In many places there was also a written constitution that provided a basis for authority in law. Athens, for its part, developed an oligarchy led by the Areopagus Council. Later, Solon, an Athenian statesman, instituted reforms and created the context in which democracy bloomed in later decades.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Persian Wars, Classical Period (546–336 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">In 546 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Greek colonies in Asia Minor fell under the rule of Cyrus the Great of Persia. Ionia unsuccessfully attempted to revolt around 500 <span class="era">BC</span>, prompting Darius I to invade the Greek mainland in 492 <span class="era">BC</span>. In the wars that followed, Greek forces were badly outnumbered, but they often outmaneuvered the Persians with superior skill and strategy. In the Battle of Marathon in 490 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Greeks soundly defeated the Persians. Ten years later, the Persian army under Xerxes famously crossed the Hellespont while the vast Persian fleet sailed into Greek waters. The Persians burned Athens, but in the end the Greeks were victorious, and Xerxes withdrew.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After the Persian Wars ended, Athens was rebuilt and entered into a remarkable period of greatness. Pericles led Athens to establish a full democracy. Vast buildings were erected on the Acropolis. Athens became wealthy, and Athenian sea power grew. It was a golden age of spectacular achievement in art, thought, literature, and architecture.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Macedonian Empire, Hellenistic Civilization (336–146 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Philip II of Macedon, with ambitions of empire, overwhelmed Athens and Thebes in 338 <span class="era">BC</span> and united Greece into the Macedonian Empire. After Philip was assassinated in 336 <span class="era">BC</span>, his son Alexander took his place. Alexander brutally destroyed a rebellious Thebes in 335 <span class="era">BC</span>, then set out to conquer Babylon and Persia, which he did with lightning speed (cp. <a href="?bref=Dan.8.5-8">Dan 8:5-8</a>). When Alexander suddenly died in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, his vast territories were divided among four generals. After a period of conflict, three major divisions emerged: Egypt; Asia Minor, Syria, and Babylon; and Macedonia and Achaia.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Alexander’s conquest spread Greek culture and influence around the ancient world. The resulting conflict between Greek culture and Judaism eventually contributed to the Maccabean revolt in Judea in the 160s <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Roman Rule (168 <span class="era">BC–AD</span> 330)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Rome expanded its power and influence into Greece beginning in 198 <span class="era">BC</span>. In 168 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome defeated the Macedonians at the battle of Pydna, and in 148 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome annexed Macedonia as a province. Then, in 146 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome destroyed Corinth. Greece was now firmly in the grip of Rome, as it continued to be until Constantine made Byzantium the capital of the Roman Empire in <span class="era">AD</span> 330. Greek culture and Roman rule formed the context for the earthly life of Jesus and the beginning of Christianity.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Hellenistic Kingdoms</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">During the 300 years following the death of Alexander in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, Greek kings continued to rule in the lands he conquered, and Hellenistic religion, culture, and values expanded across civilization. Hellenism provided a context for both Jewish and Greek learning to flourish. But Hellenism also came into conflict with Jewish faith, causing a time of great tribulation for the Jews, especially in the 160s <span class="era">BC</span>. Greek culture eventually combined with Roman rule to set the stage for the coming of the Messiah, as Daniel foresaw. The history of this era is accurately portrayed in several of Daniel’s prophecies (see <a href="?bref=Dan.7.6">7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.8.8-14">8:8-14</a>, <a href="?bref=Dan.8.21-26">21-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.4-45">11:4-45</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Successors (<span class="ital">Diadochoi</span>), 323–301 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">After Alexander died suddenly in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, a struggle for power and dominance ensued among several of his top generals (Greek <span class="ital">diadochoi,</span> “successors”).</p>
<p class="profile-body"><span class="ital">Ptolemy I</span> was one of Alexander’s strongest and most capable Macedonian generals. He became satrap of Egypt in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, the year of Alexander’s death, and he successfully ruled Egypt until his death in 285 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body"><span class="ital">Antigonus</span> was a leading general in Alexander’s army and served as the energetic regent of a large portion of Alexander’s empire. In 315 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antigonus invaded Syria and Palestine, but his bid to reunite the empire failed and he was killed in battle in 301 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body"><span class="ital">Seleucus I,</span> another of Alexander’s top generals, became satrap of Babylon in 321 <span class="era">BC</span>. When he heard of Antigonus’s plans to reunite the empire, he fled for protection to Ptolemy in Egypt in 316 <span class="era">BC</span>. After regaining control of Babylon (315 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Syria (312 <span class="era">BC</span>), he ruled until his death in 281 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body"><span class="ital">Lysimachus</span> was satrap of Thrace and Bithynia (in Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey) following the death of Alexander.</p>
<p class="profile-body"><span class="ital">Cassander</span> was satrap of Macedonia until 294 <span class="era">BC</span>. The son of Antigonus, Demetrius I, then gained control of Macedonia and Achaia, founding the Antigonid dynasty that ruled there until the Romans took control of Greece after the Battle of Pydna in 168 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Alexander’s empire was thus divided into four kingdoms ruled by Macedonian Greeks: Egypt, Babylon and Syria, Macedonia and Achaia, and parts of Asia Minor.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Throughout the 200s <span class="era">BC</span>, the Ptolemies and the Seleucids fought several wars for control of the strategic territory of Palestine. The history of this conflict is accurately portrayed in <a href="?bref=Dan.11.1-45">Daniel 11</a>.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Ptolemies, 323–30 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Ptolemy I and his descendants (the “king of the south” in <a href="?bref=Dan.11.1-45">Dan 11</a>) ruled Egypt for nearly three hundred years. After Ptolemy I took control of Judea in 319 <span class="era">BC</span>, he resettled some Jewish people in Alexandria, which became a large and important Jewish community as well as a center for both Jewish and Hellenistic learning and scholarship (the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, was created in Alexandria during this era). Even though the Ptolemies were worshiped as gods and spread Greek culture in Egypt, they were generally tolerant of the Jews and their monotheistic culture. The dynasty of the Ptolemies ended at the death of Cleopatra VII when Rome took control of Egypt in 30 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Seleucids, 321–64 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Seleucus I and his descendants (the “king of the north” in <a href="?bref=Dan.11.1-45">Dan 11</a>) ruled Syria (and, for a time, Babylon) until the Roman general Pompey annexed Syria in 64 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies, propagated both Hellenistic culture and the worship of rulers in the areas they controlled; but they were less tolerant of the Jews’ non-participation than the Ptolemies were. After the Seleucid king Antiochus III gained control of Judea around 200 <span class="era">BC</span>, he gave positions and power to Jews who assimilated. His son, Antiochus IV, harshly persecuted the Jews, executing those who kept the Sabbath or copies of the Torah or who would not worship at the altar of Zeus that he erected in the Temple in Jerusalem (note Daniel’s mention of the “sacrilegious object that causes desecration,” <a href="?bref=Dan.11.31">Dan 11:31</a>). This persecution provoked the revolt of the Jewish priest Mattathias and his sons, who gained semi-autonomy for the Jewish state for nearly one hundred years under the leadership of their descendants (the Hasmoneans).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Zerubbabel</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Zerubbabel, a Babylonian-born Jew, relocated to Judea in 538 <span class="era">BC</span> as governor of Jerusalem under Persian rule. Cyrus, the king of Persia, had declared that Jews captured and exiled from Judah might return to their homeland; Zerubbabel led one of the first groups of returning exiles.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Zerubbabel came to Judea with the mission of rebuilding the Temple, and he began by constructing the altar. Sacrifice could begin again once the Holy Place was restored. However, the community of Judea soon ran into opposition from the people in the land, who effectively shut down construction. The Judeans were distracted from the project until the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them to begin working again. Zerubbabel was instrumental in leading and organizing the Temple rebuilding effort, which took about six years (520–515 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Exuberant hope surrounded Zerubbabel, who was a direct descendant of King David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1-19">1 Chr 3:1-19</a>). Zechariah and Haggai both describe Zerubbabel in messianic terms as the one chosen by God to bring restoration to Israel (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.21-23">Hag 2:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6-7">Zech 4:6-7</a>). But Zerubbabel soon disappears from the biblical narrative without explanation. This early governor of Judea was not the Messiah. Rather, Jesus Christ, one of Zerubbabel’s descendants (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.12">Matt 1:12</a>), would assume that glorious position.</p>

<title>Antiochus IV</title>
<refs>Dan.11.21-39</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Antiochus IV</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Antiochus IV is the most important of all the Seleucid rulers as far as the biblical literature is concerned and is known as one of the cruelest tyrants of all time. He was an enthusiastic believer in the Olympian god Zeus and hoped to unify his territories by spreading Hellenistic culture, law, and religion. In so doing, he came into violent conflict with the Jews in Judea.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Antiochus IV, born in 215 <span class="era">BC</span> with the name Mithradates, was a son of Antiochus III but was not the designated heir of the Seleucid kingdom. After the Battle of Magnesia in 190 <span class="era">BC</span>, Mithradates went to Rome as a hostage to guarantee payment of his father’s debts to Rome. His brother, Seleucus IV, then began to reign in 187 <span class="era">BC</span>, but Mithradates used intrigue to get himself released from bondage and when his brother was murdered, he usurped the Seleucid throne, becoming Antiochus IV. He called himself Epiphanes, which means “god manifest.” But his unstable temper led critics to use the pejorative nickname Epimanes, which means “manifestly insane.”</p>
<p class="profile-body">Antiochus’s drive for Hellenization and his need for finances created a ripe environment for him to sell the Jewish high priesthood to the highest Hellenizing bidder. He sold the office twice, first to Jason in 174 <span class="era">BC</span> and then to Menalaus (who offered a higher bid) in 171 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Antiochus wanted to gain control of Egypt, so in 169 <span class="era">BC</span> he invaded. Meanwhile, Jason seized control of Jerusalem, attempting to take back the high priest’s office. Jason failed, but Antiochus smelled insurrection, so on his return from a successful campaign in Egypt he attacked Jerusalem, killed and enslaved thousands, and plundered the Temple. The following year, Antiochus again attacked Egypt, but this time Roman forces came to Egypt’s aid, and Antiochus was stopped outside Alexandria. There he was humiliated by the Roman legate Popilius, who famously drew a circle around him and forced him to make a decision to surrender before leaving the circle.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In 167 <span class="era">BC</span>, a maddened Antiochus sent troops to massacre the male population of Jerusalem and enslave the women and children. By Antiochus’s edict, Judaism was made illegal under pain of death, and Jews were forced to participate in pagan sacrifices. He evidently thought that destroying the Jewish nation would secure his borders and strengthen his Hellenization program. Instead, it had the opposite effect: Open rebellion broke out later that same year in the village of Modein near Jerusalem. When the king’s representative came to Modein to enforce the edict banning Judaism, a Jewish priest named Mattathias killed him and then fled with his followers to the surrounding hills. This sparked the Maccabean rebellion, in which Mattathias’s sons gained control of Jerusalem and cleansed the Temple in 164 <span class="era">BC</span>. They eventually achieved semi-independence for Judea.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Antiochus was already considered insane by many, but the success of the Maccabees and Antiochus’s inability to suppress the Jewish revolt drove him further into madness. He withdrew to Persia where he died in 164 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Maccabees</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Maccabees (meaning, “hammers”) successfully led a revolt against Antiochus IV in response to his persecution of the Jews. They and their descendants (called Hasmoneans) ruled Judea for nearly a hundred years and helped form Jewish society as we see it in the time of Jesus.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Maccabean Revolt (166–142 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">When Antiochus IV made the practice of Judaism punishable by death in 167 <span class="era">BC</span>, many Jews acquiesced, while others passively resisted and paid with their lives. Soon, more active resistance arose. When a representative of Antiochus IV came to the town of Modein to require the Jews to perform a pagan sacrifice, a priest named Mattathias killed him and then said, “Everyone who is zealous for the law of Moses and wants to obey the covenant, follow me!” (<span class="ital">1 Maccabees</span> 2:27). He then fled to the mountains with his sons and some other followers.</p> 
<p class="profile-body">Mattathias, who was very old, soon died, but before his death, he appointed his son Judas to lead the revolt. Judas was a tactical genius and charismatic commander. He, his brothers, and their followers succeeded in defeating Seleucid attacks and liberating most of Judea. After gaining control of Jerusalem, Judas and his band of rebels immediately set about to cleanse the Temple and restore the daily sacrifices, so that daily worship could be resumed. This restoration and rededication was then memorialized in the Festival of Dedication or Lights (Hanukkah). Judas opposed the appointment of a Hellenistic high priest and sought additional political freedom. He defeated the Seleucid army that was dispatched to put down the uprising, but the Seleucid king responded by sending a much larger army. Most of Judas’s men deserted, and Judas was killed in the battle of Elasa (160 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">After Judas was killed, the Maccabees regrouped under his younger brother Jonathan, who was a skilled politician and commander. Over the next few years the Maccabees regained control of Judea once more. Jonathan secured the high priesthood and allied himself with Rome. But the Seleucid general Tryphon tricked him, took him hostage, and murdered him in 143 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Another brother, Simon, followed Jonathan as leader of the Maccabees. In 142 <span class="era">BC</span>, Simon extracted a treaty from Seleucid king Demetrius II, whereby Judea became independent. Simon retained the office of high priest, and it became a hereditary position for his family. Simon was assassinated by his son-in-law in 135 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Hasmonean Rule (142–63 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The rule of Mattathias’s son Simon marks the transition from the Maccabean rebel movement to the Hasmonean dynasty, named for Mattathias’s great-grandfather Asmoneus. Simon’s descendants ruled Judea for close to a hundred years. This era saw the increasing Hellenization of Jewish political leadership. At the same time, the Pharisees gained popularity as they sought to preserve orthodox Judaism. Meanwhile, separatist groups such as the Essenes removed themselves completely from Jewish society. Toward the end of this period, the struggle for control between two brothers, Aristobulus and Hyrcanus II, led to political instability and provided Rome an opportunity to bring peace and assert control.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Roman Rule (beginning 63 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">In 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Roman general Pompey marched on Jerusalem, and Judea became a tributary to Rome. Judea then entered a period of relative peace. With the end of Hasmonean rule, the stage was set for the coming of a new and strong religious leader for the Jewish people, the long-awaited Messiah.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Herod the Great</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Herod the Great was the Roman-appointed king of Judea (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>) at the time of Jesus’ birth (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1">Matt 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Luke 1:5</a>). He was a strong military leader, a brilliant politician, and a cruel tyrant. Born into an Idumean (Edomite) family with links to the Romans, he rose to power by gaining Roman favor and retained it by cruelly suppressing his opponents.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Herod was known for his large building projects. His greatest accomplishment was the rebuilding and beautification of the Jerusalem Temple, begun ~20 <span class="era">BC</span> (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 15.8.1), making it one of the most magnificent buildings in the ancient world. He also built Caesarea and made it the Roman headquarters in Palestine. Herod earned the title “the Great” because of his reputation as a great builder.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Herod was also known for his family troubles and his brutal treatment of those who opposed him or whom he considered threats. He murdered two of his wives and three of his own sons when he suspected them of plotting against him. Caesar Augustus once said that he would rather be Herod’s <span class="ital">swine</span> than his <span class="ital">son</span> (a play on words in Greek since the two words sound alike—<span class="greek">hus, huios</span>). When Jesus was born toward the end of Herod’s reign and Herod heard him referred to as a future “king,” Herod attempted to have him killed also. Unable to locate the boy, Herod ordered the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in the Bethlehem area (see <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-20">Matt 2:1-20</a>)—an act typical of his ruthlessness and paranoia.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though Herod gained the title “king of the Jews,” the Jewish people never accepted him as a legitimate king because he was not from the line of David and because he was an Edomite (a descendant of Esau) rather than a Jew.</p>

<title>The Pharisees</title>
<refs>Matt.3.7-10</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">The Pharisees</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Pharisees were one of three major Jewish sects, along with the Sadducees and the Essenes. The Pharisees comprised a non-political lay movement within Judaism. They arose from the <span class="ital">hasidim</span> (pious ones), who opposed the syncretizing (combining together) of Greek culture and religion with Judaism in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Pharisees attempted, by rigorous examination of the details of the Old Testament law, to make the law accessible and practical to people seeking to be obedient Jews. They taught strict adherence to the law, not only the written law of Moses (<span class="ital">torah</span>), but also the oral traditions which they claimed Moses had passed down to them. Their goal was to defend the written law against any possible infringement. They were God-fearing and law-abiding people. They were known for passing their interpretations from generation to generation by word of mouth, establishing an oral tradition concerning legal matters. They made the law applicable by extracting from it specific guidelines for many possible situations. They argued that if the law were obeyed by all, the nation would be purged of sin and God would establish his Kingdom over all the nations. This gave their concern for obedience a goal in the future. The traditions of the Pharisees developed into the rabbinic writings known as the <span class="ital">Mishnah</span> and the <span class="ital">Talmud</span>.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Although the Pharisees were small in number, their influence on Israel was widespread (see <a href="?bref=Matt.15.12-14">Matt 15:12-14</a>; see also Josephus, <span class="ital">War</span> 2.8.14; <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.10.5). The primary influence of the Pharisees was in the local synagogue communities, while the Sadducees were more influential in the worship at the Temple in Jerusalem and in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high council.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Unlike the Sadducees, the Pharisees had a strong belief in the resurrection of the dead (see <a href="?bref=Acts.23.6-8">Acts 23:6-8</a>). After the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the Pharisees provided leadership and direction for the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jesus often came into conflict with the Pharisees, accusing them of hypocrisy and of elevating human rules over God’s righteous standards. Jesus opposed the Pharisees because they were leading people away from God’s plan for redemption. They were the theological shepherds of Israel, but Jesus castigated them as hypocrites for their perversions of doctrine and practice (see <a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-39">Matt 23</a>). And the Pharisees were antagonistic toward Jesus, rejecting both him and his work, largely because of his shocking disregard of their traditions (see e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.15.1-20">Matt 15:1-20</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Matthew (Levi)</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Matthew was a tax collector for the Romans and became one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. According to early tradition, he was the author of the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though he is called Matthew in all the lists of the apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Matt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>), he is referred to as Levi—his other name—in two of the accounts of his calling (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.14-15">Mark 2:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27-29">Luke 5:27-29</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-10">Matt 9:9-10</a>). His father was named Alphaeus (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mark 2:14</a>), but there is no certainty that he is the brother of James the son of Alphaeus (the two are not linked in the lists of the apostles, as the other pairs of brothers are).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jews who collected taxes for the Romans were generally considered despicable sinners by their fellow Jews. They profited from working for the occupying forces and engaged in legalized extortion. Thus it is significant that Jesus called a tax collector to become one of his followers. When Jesus was criticized by the Pharisees for accepting Matthew’s invitation to his home for dinner, and for eating with tax collectors and other disreputable sinners, Jesus used the occasion to teach the importance of compassion. He emphasized that it was precisely for such sinners—not those who considered themselves righteous—that he had come (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-13">Matt 9:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.14-17">Mark 2:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27-32">Luke 5:27-32</a>). Matthew responded immediately to Jesus’ call, leaving everything behind to follow Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.28">Luke 5:28</a>). The implication is that he never turned back to tax collecting or his former way of life.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Matthew’s Gospel, written for his fellow Jews, gives us a Jewish perspective on the life and teachings of Jesus, and it includes topics of special interest for those from a Jewish background. His Gospel was the most popular Gospel in the early church, which is probably why it occurs first in the canonical sequence.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Simon Peter</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Simon Peter was the most prominent of the twelve apostles. After Jesus’ death, he became the primary spokesman for the early Christians in Jerusalem and was the apostle primarily responsible for evangelizing the Jews (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.7-8">Gal 2:7-8</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Hebrew name <span class="ital">Simeon</span> (transliterated in English as “Simon”) was probably his original name. <span class="ital">Cephas</span> is the transliteration of an Aramaic name given him by Jesus, meaning “rock”—translated in Greek as <span class="ital">Petros</span> (English “Peter”; see <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17-18">Matt 16:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.42">John 1:42</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though Bethsaida was Peter’s hometown (<a href="?bref=John.1.44">John 1:44</a>), he later lived in Capernaum. He was married (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">1 Cor 9:5</a>), and at one point, when visiting Peter’s home, Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.14-15">Matt 8:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.29-31">Mark 1:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.38-39">Luke 4:38-39</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Originally fishermen, Peter and his brother Andrew were among the first to be called by Jesus to be disciples, together with James and John, their fishing partners (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-22">Matt 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">Mark 1:16-20</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.5.1-11">Luke 5:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.35-51">John 1:35-51</a>). They were ordinary, minimally educated working men (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.13">Acts 4:13</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Peter’s name occurs first on every list of the twelve apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2">Matt 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.16">Mark 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.14">Luke 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>). Together with the brothers James and John, Peter was part of an “inner circle” of disciples who were with Jesus on certain special occasions—the healing of Jairus’s daughter (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">Mark 5:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.51">Luke 8:51</a>), Jesus’ transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-2">Matt 17:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">Mark 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-29">Luke 9:28-29</a>), and Jesus’ prayer in the garden (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.37">Matt 26:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.33">Mark 14:33</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Peter was bold and impulsive (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.33">Matt 26:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.29">Mark 14:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.8">Luke 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.33">22:33</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.36-37">John 13:36-37</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.7">21:7</a>), and the first of the disciples to confess his belief in Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.15-16">Matt 16:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.29">Mark 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.20">Luke 9:20</a>). He reproved Jesus when Jesus spoke of his coming death—a notion that did not fit Peter’s view of the Messiah—and was in turn rebuked by Jesus for it (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21-23">Matt 16:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31-33">Mark 8:31-33</a>). However, Jesus spoke of Peter as a key person he would use to build the church (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.18-19">Matt 16:18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Peter surreptitiously entered the courtyard of the high priest when Jesus was taken there for interrogation. But when challenged by people who recognized him (partly because of his Galilean accent), he vigorously denied all knowledge of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.69-75">26:69-75</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.66-72">Mark 14:66-72</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.54-62">Luke 22:54-62</a>)—as Jesus had said he would, in spite of Peter’s insistence that he would never do so (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.33-35">Matt 26:33-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.29-31">Mark 14:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.31-34">Luke 22:31-34</a>). Peter immediately felt deep remorse.</p>
<p class="profile-body">After the news of Jesus’ resurrection, Peter was one of the first to run to the tomb to see if it was true (<a href="?bref=John.20.3-7">John 20:3-7</a>), and he appears to have been the first of the Twelve to whom the risen Jesus showed himself (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.33-34">Luke 24:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.5">1 Cor 15:5</a>). Much of Jesus’ conversation recorded in <a href="?bref=John.21.1-25">John 21</a> was with Peter, whom Jesus encouraged to “feed my sheep” (<a href="?bref=John.21.15-17">John 21:15-17</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Following the coming of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-13">Acts 2:1-13</a>), Peter quickly emerged as the primary spokesman for the early Christians. From that point on, as recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.14-12.25">Acts 2:14–12:25</a>, he played a crucial role in the spread of the gospel in Judea, boldly preaching to the crowds (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.14-41">Acts 2:14-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.12-26">3:12-26</a>), healing people (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-11">Acts 3:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.12-16">5:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-43">9:32-43</a>), and—even under arrest—speaking fearlessly to the authorities (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-20">Acts 4:1-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.26-32">5:26-32</a>). Twice he miraculously escaped from prison (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.18-25">Acts 5:18-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.6-11">12:6-11</a>). He also exercised leadership in the administrative affairs of the quickly growing community of disciples (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.3-11">Acts 5:3-11</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Peter was the first to bring the Good News to Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">Acts 10:1-48</a>; see <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matt 16:18</a>). And he played a key role in the Jerusalem council concerning Gentile converts, arguing that Gentiles should not be compelled to observe the law of Moses but should be accepted on the basis of their faith in Christ alone (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.7-11">Acts 15:7-11</a>). Later, however, when visiting Antioch, he was inconsistent on this point—resulting in a rebuke from Paul (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-16">Gal 2:11-16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Other than his taking his wife with him on at least some of his mission trips (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">1 Cor 9:5</a>), few details are known about Peter’s later life and missionary work. (He may have spent time at Corinth; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.12">1 Cor 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.22">3:22</a>). Widespread early tradition says that Peter was crucified—like his Lord, just as Jesus had predicted (<a href="?bref=John.21.18-19">John 21:18-19</a>)—in Rome during Nero’s persecution of Christians in <span class="era">AD</span> 64–65. The reliability of the tradition that he was crucified upside-down is less certain.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Peter was likely the source of the material recorded by Mark in his Gospel, which Mark probably learned while he was assisting Peter in his evangelistic work in Italy near the end of his life. Peter is also traditionally understood to be the author of 1 Peter (written from Rome—“Babylon,” <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Pet 5:13</a>) and 2 Peter.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In the New Testament, Peter stands as a reassuring example of Christ’s forgiving grace for those who know they’ve failed him—and of the way Christ can graciously restore and use such people for his glory, in spite of their failings.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">The Sadducees</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The Sadducees were made up of the priestly class (in contrast to the lay movement of the Pharisees). The Sadducees probably lived in the vicinity of Jerusalem and controlled the Temple system (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-2">Acts 4:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.17">5:17</a>). They were powerful aristocrats and mediators between Rome and Israel (see Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.10.6;<span class="ital"> War</span> 2.10.5). They did not have great favor or influence with the people (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.4). The term <span class="ital">Sadducee</span> probably derives from <span class="ital">Zadok,</span> the high priest during the reigns of David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sam 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.24">15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.8">1 Kgs 1:8</a>) and Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.32-48">1 Kgs 1:32-48</a>); both words have the same Hebrew root. The earliest historical reference to the Sadducees occurs during the reign of John Hyrcanus (135–104 <span class="era">BC</span>), a descendant of the Maccabees (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.10.6), but it is clear from this account that they had already existed for some time.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Their theological views are often contrasted with those of the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.8">Acts 23:8</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-2">Acts 4:1-2</a>). The Pentateuch had primary authority for the Sadducees. They rejected the oral tradition so cherished by the Pharisees. Also in contrast with the Pharisees, the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead (see <a href="?bref=Matt.22.23-33">Matt 22:23-33</a>), angelic beings (see <a href="?bref=Acts.23.8">Acts 23:8</a>), or the concept of final judgment. The Pharisees, by contrast, were so committed to belief in the resurrection that they sided with Paul against the Sadducees when he was on trial for disturbing the Temple (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.6-10">Acts 23:6-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Despite their differences, the Pharisees and Sadducees united with a single front against Jesus. If the Pharisees opposed Jesus because he made light of their oral traditions, the Sadducees opposed Jesus because he affirmed the supernatural world of angels and demons and appealed to a final judgment and resurrection.</p>
<p class="profile-body">With the destruction of the Temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the Sadducees disappeared from the scene. They left no written records. Since all our information about the Sadducees comes from their opponents, we have a limited idea of what they were really like.</p>

<p class="profile-body">According to Jewish tradition, the Sanhedrin dates from Moses’ choice of seventy elders (<a href="?bref=Num.11.16">Num 11:16</a>), but the earliest datable reference is found in Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.3.3) from the time of Antiochus the Great (223–187 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Sanhedrin probably emerged from a self-governing body of leaders under the Persians (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.5-10">Ezra 5:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.16">Neh 2:16</a>). The high council was controlled by the priestly class under the leadership of the high priest, though these priests were influenced to various degrees by Roman rulers and the Pharisees. Herod the Great exercised a particularly heavy hand over the affairs of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Sanhedrin managed the internal legal and religious affairs of Judaism, including judicial decisions not resolved in lesser courts (called “local sanhedrins”), criminal justice and arrests (see <a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-2">Acts 9:1-2</a>), and official (though unenforceable) decisions regarding Jewish matters. Though the Sanhedrin could not of its own accord put tried criminals to death (<a href="?bref=John.18.31">John 18:31</a>), apparently it could do so with the support of Roman officials.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 eliminated the high council as the ruling body of Judaism.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Women Named Mary</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Four other Marys, apart from the mother of Jesus, are mentioned in the Gospels:</p>
<p class="profile-body">(1) Mary Magdalene (probably from Magdala in Galilee) was freed from demon possession by Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.9">Mark 16:9</a>) and became a faithful follower and financial supporter of Jesus and his disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.1-3">Luke 8:1-3</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.27.55-56">Matt 27:55-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40-41">Mark 15:40-41</a>). She was present when Jesus was crucified and buried (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.55-61">Matt 27:55-61</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40-47">Mark 15:40-47</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.25">John 19:25</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.23.49">Luke 23:49</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.23.55-56">55-56</a>), and she went to the tomb early on Sunday morning with burial spices. She was among the first to be told of his resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-8">Matt 28:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1-8">Mark 16:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.1-11">Luke 24:1-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.24.22-24">22-24</a>), and she was the first to see the resurrected Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.9-10">Matt 28:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.9-11">Mark 16:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.1-2">John 20:1-2</a>, <a href="?bref=John.20.11-18">11-18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">(2) Mary the mother of James the younger (not the same person as James the apostle) and Joseph was also among the women who were present when Jesus was crucified and buried (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.55-61">Matt 27:55-61</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40-47">Mark 15:40-47</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.23.49">Luke 23:49</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.23.55">55</a>). Like Mary Magdalene, she was among the first who heard the news of his resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-8">Matt 28:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1-8">Mark 16:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.1-11">Luke 24:1-11</a>), and she was one of the first to see the risen Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.9-10">Matt 28:9-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">(3) Mary of Bethany was the sister of Martha and Lazarus; their family was much loved by Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.11.5">John 11:5</a>). Jesus commended Mary for her eagerness to learn from him (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">Luke 10:38-42</a>). Soon after Jesus had raised her brother from the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.32-45">John 11:32-45</a>), Mary anointed Jesus’ feet with very expensive perfume, an act defended by Jesus when others criticized it as extravagant (<a href="?bref=John.12.1-11">John 12:1-11</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">Matt 26:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9">Mark 14:3-9</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">(4) Mary the wife of Clopas was also among the women watching when Jesus was crucified (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">John 19:25</a>). Her husband, Clopas, is not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.</p>

<title>Herod Antipas</title>
<refs>Mark.6.14-29</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Herod Antipas</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Herod Antipas, sixth son of Herod the Great, was ruler of Galilee and Perea from 4 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 39, during the life of Jesus. His jurisdiction included the regions where Jesus and John the Baptist concentrated their ministries.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Following the example of his father, Herod Antipas founded cities. Sepphoris, his first project, was the largest city in Galilee. It was Antipas’s capital city until he built Tiberias, named in honor of the reigning emperor, Tiberius (<span class="era">AD</span> 14–37). The city Tiberias was on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Antipas completed the city in <span class="era">AD</span> 23 and made it his capital.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Herod Antipas offended many Jews by divorcing his wife and marrying Herodias, the wife of his half brother, Herod Philip. Antipas’s marriage to Herodias was in violation of the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.16">Lev 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.21">20:21</a>) because Herod’s brother Philip was still alive. When John the Baptist spoke out strongly against this illegal marriage, Antipas imprisoned him (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-18">Mark 6:17-18</a>); Herod was afraid John’s denunciation would lead to a political revolt (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.5.2). Later, at a banquet, Herodias’s daughter pleased Herod with her dancing, evoking a rash promise from him to give her anything she wanted. Herodias took the opportunity to have John beheaded (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-12">Matt 14:1-12</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">It was obvious to Antipas that Jesus’ ministry was even more remarkable than John’s (see <a href="?bref=Mark.6.14-16">Mark 6:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-2">Matt 14:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.7-9">Luke 9:7-9</a>), but he was reluctant to use force to bring about a meeting, for fear of arousing the people against him. Jesus, for his part, was openly critical of Herod Antipas (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.15">Mark 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.31-33">Luke 13:31-33</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jesus was finally arrested, Pilate could find no fault in Jesus, so he sent him to Herod Antipas, who was in Jerusalem for Passover. Pilate may also have been attempting to reconcile himself to Antipas. Their relationship had been rather strained since the Galilean massacre (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.1">Luke 13:1</a>), and because Pilate had brought votive shields to Jerusalem that bore the image of Tiberius and were considered blasphemous by the Jews (Philo, <span class="ital">On the Embassy to Gaius</span> 299–304). When Jesus was brought before Antipas, Herod only mocked him and sent him back to Pilate (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.6-11">Luke 23:6-11</a>). The main political accomplishment of the incident was that Herod and Pilate were indeed reconciled (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.12">Luke 23:12</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Herod Antipas was later defeated in war by King Aretas, whose daughter he had divorced. (Jews interpreted this defeat as an act of divine judgment.) He was then deposed by Emperor Gaius in <span class="era">AD</span> 39 and sent into exile, in response to accusations from Herod Agrippa I of Antipas’s conspiracy against Rome.</p>

<refs>Mark.14.10-11</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Judas Iscariot</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Judas Iscariot is infamous for betraying Jesus to the authorities (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.4">Matt 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.19">Mark 3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.16">Luke 6:16</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The meaning of the name “Iscariot” is uncertain; it might refer to a village named Kerioth. He is not the same person as Judas son of James (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.16">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.22">John 14:22</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Among the apostles, Judas Iscariot came to be known as greedy; he carried the money bag and had the reputation of stealing from it (<a href="?bref=John.12.4-6">John 12:4-6</a>). The money offered him as a bribe by the leading priests later convinced him to betray Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.14-16">Matt 26:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.10-11">Mark 14:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.3-6">Luke 22:3-6</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jesus called Judas himself a devil (<a href="?bref=John.6.70-71">John 6:70-71</a>) and predicted the betrayal (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.18-21">Mark 14:18-21</a>). The devil put the idea of betrayal into Judas’s mind, and Satan “entered” him at the time of the betrayal (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.3-4">Luke 22:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.2">John 13:2</a>, <a href="?bref=John.13.27">27</a>). Judas led a group of soldiers and officers to the garden of Gethsemane in the middle of the night, where he found Jesus and betrayed him with a prearranged signal, a kiss of greeting (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.43-46">Mark 14:43-46</a>). Later, Judas was apparently overcome by remorse for betraying an innocent man, and he hanged himself (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-10">Matt 27:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.18-19">Acts 1:18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jesus clearly understood Judas’s betrayal as part of God’s plan for redemption: It brought about the death of the Messiah as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.24">Matt 26:24</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.26.53-54">53-54</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.21">Mark 14:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.22">Luke 22:22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.12">John 17:12</a>). Even though Judas served God’s plan, his tragic end was clearly deserved (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.24-25">Acts 1:24-25</a>). It would have been better for Judas if he had never been born (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.24">Matt 26:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.21">Mark 14:21</a>). Judas’s fate soberly warns those who are apparently followers of Jesus but have never committed themselves to him personally (cp. <a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-6">Heb 6:4-6</a>).</p>

<title>Pontius Pilate</title>
<refs>Mark.15.1-15</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Pontius Pilate</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea from <span class="era">AD</span> 26 to 36, including the time of Jesus’ death in <span class="era">AD</span> 30 or 33. Pilate gave the official order for Jesus to be crucified.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As the governor of Judea, Pilate was in control of all the Roman occupation forces as well as the Temple and its funds. He was the only one who had the authority to execute criminals (see <a href="?bref=John.18.31">John 18:31</a>), so the Jewish authorities were compelled to bring charges before Pilate in order to have Jesus executed (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.1-4">Mark 15:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Pilate was sometimes abusive as governor. He appropriated Temple funds to construct a thirty-five-mile aqueduct for Jerusalem, provoking a major protest. In response, Pilate had soldiers infiltrate the crowds in disguise and beat the offenders to death with clubs (Josephus, <span class="ital">War</span> 2.9.4; <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.3.2). Another time, Pilate murdered some Galileans “as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple” (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.1">Luke 13:1</a>); this incident might have estranged him from the Galilean ruler Herod Antipas. Pilate also tried to bring images of Caesar into Jerusalem for worship. Later (<span class="era">AD</span> 36), Pilate slaughtered pilgrims who followed a Samaritan false prophet, an event that led to his dismissal by the emperor Tiberius in the same year.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Each Gospel records Pilate’s role in the death of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.11-26">Matt 27:11-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.1-15">Mark 15:1:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.1-25">Luke 23:1-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.28–19.16">John 18:28–19:16</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.3.13">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.27">4:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.28">13:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.13">1 Tim 6:13</a>). After interrogating Jesus, he was convinced that Jesus had done nothing deserving of death, so he tried to return the case to the Jewish authorities. When they resisted, he tried to pass Jesus to Herod Antipas for judgment—but he, too, refused the case. Pilate finally tried appealing to a traditional Roman custom of freeing a prisoner on Passover. Meanwhile, his wife had been deeply troubled by a dream about “that innocent man” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.19">Matt 27:19</a>). But the clamor of the crowd became threatening, and the Jewish leaders began insinuating that Pilate was not taking Jesus’ threat to Rome seriously. Pilate yielded to Jewish pressure. He ordered that Jesus be whipped and then crucified, with the title “King of the Jews” posted on a sign over his head—but only after strenuously objecting and declaring himself to be innocent of the guilt of such an unjust death (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.18-25">Matt 27:18-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.14">Mark 15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.4">Luke 23:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.23.13-23">13-23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.38">John 18:38</a>); <a href="?bref=John.19.4-16">19:4-16</a>. Pilate’s attitude toward Jesus stands as a testimony that Jesus posed no threat to the Roman government but only to the Jewish leadership. This may have been a helpful point for later Christians who were portrayed as a threat to Rome.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Shortly after Jesus’ death, Pilate gave special permission to Joseph of Arimathea to take the body of Jesus from the cross and bury it (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.57-61">Matt 27:57-61</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.42-46">Mark 15:42-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.50-53">Luke 23:50-53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.38-42">John 19:38-42</a>). He also gave permission to the Jewish authorities to seal the tomb to make sure no one would steal the body or make false claims about Jesus coming back to life (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.62-66">Matt 27:62-66</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Little is known of Pilate after his dismissal in <span class="era">AD</span> 36; Eusebius reports that Pilate committed suicide during the reign of Caligula, <span class="era">AD</span> 37–41 (Eusebius, <span class="ital">Church History</span> 2.7).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Mary, Mother of Jesus</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Mary, the wife of Joseph, was the virgin mother of Jesus. Luke tells us that as a young girl in Nazareth, Mary was betrothed to Joseph, a local carpenter. Before the marriage took place, an angel announced to her that she would become pregnant by the power of God’s Spirit and give birth to the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-35">Luke 1:26-35</a>). Mary responded to this extraordinary message in simple faith, humbly submitting herself to God’s will (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.38">Luke 1:38</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Luke 1:46-55</a>). Shortly thereafter, the message was confirmed by her relative Elizabeth, who spoke of Mary as the most blessed of all women (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.39-45">Luke 1:39-45</a>). Mary’s miraculous bearing of the Son of God was viewed as a fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isa 7:14</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jesus’ birth took place in unusual circumstances, when Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem to register for an official Roman census. The child was born in a stable because no other lodging was available (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-7">Luke 2:1-7</a>). Some time later, Mary and Joseph fled to Egypt to save the child from Herod’s massacre of young boys in the Bethlehem area (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-18">Matt 2:13-18</a>). When they returned, they resettled in Nazareth to raise their family (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.19-23">Matt 2:19-23</a>). After Jesus’ birth, Mary apparently gave birth to several other sons and daughters (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55-56">Matt 13:55-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mark 6:3</a>). It is likely that Mary herself told Luke the details of Jesus’ birth and the unusual events associated with it (see <a href="?bref=Luke.2.51">Luke 2:51</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jesus was twelve years old, he stayed in the Temple during a family trip to Jerusalem. Mary and Joseph rebuked him for staying behind when they departed, but they did not understand Jesus’ response (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.41-51">Luke 2:41-51</a>). Early in Jesus’ public ministry, Mary encouraged him to do a miracle at a wedding in Cana (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-11">John 2:1-11</a>). Later, when she and Jesus’ brothers went to see Jesus, he said that his disciples were his “real family” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.46-50">Matt 12:46-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.31-35">Mark 3:31-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.19-21">Luke 8:19-21</a>).</p>

<refs>Luke.5.10-11</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">James, Son of Zebedee</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">James, son of Zebedee and brother of John, was one of the twelve apostles, and he was among the first to be killed as a follower of Jesus. His mother was possibly the sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus, which would make him Jesus’ cousin (cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">Matt 27:56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.25">John 19:25</a>). His name usually occurs before that of John, which may suggest that James was the older of the two. He should not be confused with James, son of Alphaeus (see <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Luke 6:15</a>) or James, brother of Jesus.</p>
<p class="profile-body">James and John were fishermen like their father (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.21">Matt 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.19">Mark 1:19</a>); they fished with Peter and Andrew, another pair of brothers who became disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.10">Luke 5:10</a>). They were among the first that Jesus called to be his disciples, and they left everything, including their father, to follow him (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.22">Matt 4:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.20">Mark 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.11">Luke 5:11</a>). Jesus called them “Sons of Thunder” (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mark 3:17</a>), which might imply that they had vehement personalities (see <a href="?bref=Luke.9.54">Luke 9:54</a>), though the exact connotation is unclear.</p>
<p class="profile-body">James and his brother John were among those closest to Jesus. With Peter, they formed an inner circle of trusted disciples who accompanied Jesus on special occasions, as when he healed Jairus’s daughter (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">Mark 5:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.51">Luke 8:51</a>), conversed with Elijah and Moses on a mountain (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-3">Matt 17:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2-4">Mark 9:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-30">Luke 9:28-30</a>), and agonized in prayer in the garden (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.37">Matt 26:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.33">Mark 14:33</a>). At one point, the two brothers provoked the indignation of the other disciples by asking for special positions of privilege in the coming Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.20-28">Matt 20:20-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-45">Mark 10:35-45</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.22.24-27">Luke 22:24-27</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Perhaps because of James’s prominence among the disciples, Herod Agrippa had him killed soon after Jesus’ death, which pleased the Jewish leaders (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-3">Acts 12:1-3</a>) and fulfilled Jesus’ prediction about his drinking the bitter cup that Jesus drank (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.23">Matt 20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.38-39">Mark 10:38-39</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">James was an ordinary working person whom Jesus called to be his disciple. His willingness to leave everything he knew—work, family, and home—to follow Jesus in simple trust, and eventually to die for him, makes him a model of committed discipleship.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Martha, Mary, and Lazarus</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The sisters Martha and Mary lived with their brother Lazarus in Bethany, near Jerusalem; Jesus loved and spent time with this family. Martha and Mary are mentioned only in the Gospels of Luke and John, while Lazarus appears only in John (this Lazarus is not Lazarus the beggar from <a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Luke 16:19-31</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Luke’s account of these two sisters (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">10:38-42</a>) focuses on the contrast between Martha and Mary. When Jesus visited their home, Martha was busy in the kitchen and became upset with her sister for not helping her prepare the meal. Jesus defended Mary’s desire to simply sit and learn from him as the most important thing.</p>
<p class="profile-body">John’s Gospel relays Jesus’ act of raising Lazarus from the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.1-44">John 11:1-44</a>). When Jesus arrived in Bethany, four days after Lazarus had died, the sisters expressed their dismay that Jesus had not come in time to heal their sick brother, and Jesus was deeply moved by the weeping of Lazarus’s family and friends. He went to the tomb and ordered Lazarus to come out. To everyone’s astonishment, he did so, bound in the cloths he had been buried in. This amazing miracle exemplifies Jesus as the giver of eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.11.25-26">John 11:25-26</a>). Ironically, this act of restoring Lazarus’s life also galvanized the Jewish leaders to bring about Jesus’ death because so many people were responding to Jesus’ miracles (<a href="?bref=John.11.47-53">John 11:47-53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.10-11">12:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Soon thereafter, when the family invited Jesus to their home for a celebration meal, Mary poured a bottle of extremely expensive perfume on Jesus. When people criticized her for what they considered an extravagant waste, Jesus defended her action, saying that it anticipated his coming death (<a href="?bref=John.12.1-8">John 12:1-8</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">Matt 26:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9">Mark 14:3-9</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">John the Baptist</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">John the Baptist was a fiery open-air preacher who called people to repent and be baptized. John worked in the role of Elijah, to prepare people for the coming of the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.4-5">Mal 4:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.14">Matt 11:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.12">17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.13">Mark 9:13</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">John’s birth, like that of Jesus, was miraculous. His parents were elderly and had been unable to have children (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.5-25">Luke 1:5-25</a>). His mother, Elizabeth, was a relative of Mary, Jesus’ mother (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.36">Luke 1:36</a>), so John was related to Jesus. The two miraculous births around the same time signaled the beginning of God’s redeeming work.</p>
<p class="profile-body">John was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth and devoted his life to preparing people for the coming of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.15-17">Luke 1:15-17</a>). Living in the desert (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.80">Luke 1:80</a>), he began preaching when he was about thirty years old. Dressed like a prophet and subsisting on desert food (locusts and wild honey, see <a href="?bref=Matt.3.4">Matt 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mark 1:6</a>), he called everyone to repent and be baptized (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.1-2">Matt 3:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.4">Mark 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.1-3">Luke 3:1-3</a>). He even castigated the religious leaders who came to hear him (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.7-10">Matt 3:7-10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though John reluctantly baptized Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.13-17">Matt 3:13-17</a>), he considered Jesus his superior, the one who would “baptize with the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=John.1.33">John 1:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Matt 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.7-8">Mark 1:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Luke 3:16</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=John.3.23-30">John 3:23-30</a>). He encouraged his followers to become Jesus’ disciples—and many did, including Andrew (<a href="?bref=John.1.35-40">1:35-40</a>), Apollos (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-26">Acts 18:24-26</a>), and the twelve disciples at Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-7">Acts 19:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Herod Antipas received harsh judgment from John because of Herod’s unlawful marriage to Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. To please Herodias, Herod imprisoned John and then beheaded him (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-12">Matt 14:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-29">Mark 6:17-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.19-20">Luke 3:19-20</a>). John’s imprisonment marked the beginning of Jesus’ public preaching (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.12">Matt 4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.14">Mark 1:14</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Shortly before his death, John seemed to be confused about Jesus and sent messengers from prison to ask him if he really was the Messiah. Jesus did not do what most people anticipated the Messiah would do. Rather than bringing judgment and a visible kingdom, he brought forgiveness, healing, and a spiritual kingdom. To reassure John, Jesus spoke of the miraculous things God was doing through him (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.18-23">Luke 7:18-23</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">John remained faithful to his calling throughout his life, consistently preaching repentance and the judgment of God, even to people who had no desire to hear it. Jesus referred to John as one of the greatest servants of God who had ever lived (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-19">Matt 11:2-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.18-35">Luke 7:18-35</a>), the end of a long line of prophets anticipating the coming of the Kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.16">Luke 16:16</a>). John stood on the threshold of the new age, proclaiming its coming to all who would hear.</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Nicodemus was a highly respected Jewish Pharisee (<a href="?bref=John.3.1">John 3:1</a>), one of the prominent members of the high council, who appears to have become a convert of Jesus. He is mentioned only in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Intrigued by the authority of Jesus and the miracles he was doing, Nicodemus went to see him secretly, at night, in an attempt to discover who he really was.

<p class="profile-title">Samaritans</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Samaria was a geographic region north of Judea centered around the ancient city of Shechem (Sychar in the New Testament was located at or near the site of Shechem). After Israel was conquered in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> and the cities of Samaria and Shechem were destroyed, this region was repopulated with people from throughout the Assyrian empire (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.21-41">2 Kgs 17:21-41</a>). These inhabitants introduced countless pagan practices, making the religious impurity of the land infamous. In time, the monotheism of Judaism prevailed, but with significant modifications: The Samaritan scriptures were limited to the Pentateuch, and their worship was centered on a new temple on Mount Gerizim above Shechem.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The Samaritans also had a long history of conflict with the Jews, beginning after the Jews’ return from exile (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-5">Ezra 4:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-23">Neh 4:1-23</a>). Alexander the Great and later Greek generals made Shechem an important base, knowing that they could find sympathetic, anti-Jewish allies there. The Jews destroyed Shechem in 128 <span class="era">BC</span> and burned the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim. The Samaritans returned the favor in <span class="era">AD</span> 6–9 when they desecrated the Jerusalem Temple by scattering human bones from a cemetery during one Passover. By Jesus’ day, smoldering tension existed between Judea and Samaria.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Jews in the time of Jesus therefore avoided traveling through this land whose people they perceived as hostile and impure. When Jesus traveled through Samaria and met a Samaritan woman, all of the fraught tensions of this relationship are in view. A first-century reader would barely expect Jesus and the woman to acknowledge each other, much less speak. Yet Jesus reached beyond his ethnic identity to call even a Samaritan woman of ill-repute to believe.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Jewish Leaders</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Jesus experienced numerous conflicts with Jewish leaders throughout his public ministry. These opponents viewed themselves as defending the Temple and its sacrifices or the synagogue and its teachings. In Jesus’ final week in Jerusalem, these debates intensified (see <a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-39">Matt 23</a>) and contributed to the case against him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When John wrote his Gospel, Christians were being persecuted by local Jewish synagogues, and the language of those conflicts spilled over into John’s Gospel (see <a href="?bref=Acts.14.19">Acts 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.14">1 Thes 2:14</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gal.1.13-14">Gal 1:13-14</a>). The Greek term translated “Jewish leaders” could be literally translated as “Jews.” But the word took on this technical meaning to refer to the Temple leadership who confronted Jesus, judged him, and orchestrated his crucifixion (see <a href="?bref=John.1.19">John 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.18">2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.9-18">5:9-18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.18-22">9:18-22</a>). This is important because the New Testament—particularly John’s Gospel—has often been seen as anti-Semitic. But the truth is that Jesus, who was himself a Jew, did not wrestle with “Jews” in general.

<p class="profile-title">John, Son of Zebedee</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">John, brother of James and son of Zebedee, was one of the twelve apostles. Early tradition identifies him as the author of the Gospel of John, the Letters of John, and the book of Revelation.</p>
<p class="profile-body">John and his brother James were among those closest to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">Mark 5:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.3">13:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.33">14:33</a>). His mother, Salome, might have been a sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus (cp. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">Matt 27:56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.25">John 19:25</a>). John’s name usually occurs after James’s, which suggests that John was younger. James and John were fishermen like their father (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.21">Matt 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.19">Mark 1:19</a>). They fished with Peter and Andrew, another pair of brothers who became disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.8-10">Luke 5:8-10</a>). They were among the first whom Jesus called as disciples, and they left everything to follow him (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.22">Matt 4:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.20">Mark 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.11">Luke 5:11</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=John.1.35-40">John 1:35-40</a>). Jesus named them “Sons of Thunder” (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mark 3:17</a>), which might imply that they were loud or short-tempered (see <a href="?bref=Luke.9.54">Luke 9:54</a>). At one point, the two brothers evoked the indignation of the other disciples when they asked for special positions of privilege in the coming kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.20-28">Matt 20:20-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-45">Mark 10:35-45</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Luke.22.24-27">Luke 22:24-27</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">John is understood to be the unnamed “disciple Jesus loved” and “another disciple” mentioned in the Gospel of John (<a href="?bref=John.13.23-25">John 13:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.15-16">18:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.26-27">19:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.2-10">20:2-10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.20-24">21:20-24</a>). He may have been the unnamed disciple of John the Baptist, who, together with Andrew, became an early follower of Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.1.35-40">John 1:35-40</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body" ts="profile-body 10">John’s name occurs three times in Acts; each time he was working with Peter (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-11">Acts 3:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-23">4:1-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.14-25">8:14-25</a>). Paul referred to him as one of the “pillars” of the church in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The most widespread tradition about John’s later life is that he moved to Ephesus, where he eventually became the bishop of Asia Minor, lived to an old age, and died peacefully in the company of friends. His Gospel provides a profound portrait of Jesus, and his letters provide a moving depiction of the Christian life (1–3 John).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Annas and Caiaphas</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Annas and Caiaphas were both spoken of as high priests during the time of Jesus, and they were instrumental in getting Jesus condemned to death.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Annas was the Jewish high priest around <span class="era">AD</span> 6–15. But even after he was officially deposed by the Roman procurator of Judea, he retained considerable power and influence in the Jewish high council and was still spoken of as “high priest” fifteen to twenty years later (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.2">Luke 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>)—perhaps because of the Jewish view that high priests retain their position for life. Five of his sons and his son-in-law Caiaphas became high priests after him. According to the Gospel of John, when Jesus was arrested, he was brought to Annas for his initial interrogation before he was turned over to Caiaphas for the official trial (<a href="?bref=John.18.13-24">John 18:13-24</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Caiaphas was the official Jewish high priest around <span class="era">AD</span> 18–36. He worked closely with his powerful father-in-law, Annas. Caiaphas had argued in the high council that it would be better for Jesus to be sacrificed than for the entire nation to be destroyed (<a href="?bref=John.11.49-50">John 11:49-50</a>). These prophetic words were given to him by God because of his role as high priest (<a href="?bref=John.11.51-52">John 11:51-52</a>). At the trial of Jesus, Caiaphas tore his robes at Jesus’ claim to be the Son of God and urged the high council to condemn him for blasphemy (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.57-66">Matt 26:57-66</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Not long after the execution of Jesus, the Jewish authorities became increasingly disturbed over the rapidly growing numbers of believers in Christ. Annas and Caiaphas actively involved themselves in the interrogation of Peter and John over their healing a crippled beggar and their preaching about the resurrection of the dead (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.5-7">Acts 4:5-7</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-body-fl">Thomas, also known as “the Twin,” was one of the twelve apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Matt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mark 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>). He is remembered most for his unbelieving response to Jesus’ resurrection.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nothing is known of how Jesus first met and called Thomas to be his disciple. The only personal accounts of Thomas are found in the Gospel of John. Thomas voiced his willingness to follow Jesus, even if it meant death (<a href="?bref=John.11.16">John 11:16</a>); he openly told Jesus that he didn’t understand what he was saying (<a href="?bref=John.14.5">John 14:5</a>); and he was one of the seven disciples who returned to fishing after the resurrection, when Jesus appeared to them (<a href="?bref=John.21.2">John 21:2</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Jesus first appeared to his disciples after his death, Thomas was not present. When Thomas heard the report from the others, he did not believe it, insisting he would have to see the evidence of the crucifixion on Jesus’ body with his own eyes and feel it with his own hands (<a href="?bref=John.20.19-25">John 20:19-25</a>). A week later, when Jesus once again appeared to the disciples, he specifically addressed Thomas, telling him to examine the marks of the nails and the spear on his body and challenging him to believe and not be skeptical (<a href="?bref=John.20.26-27">John 20:26-27</a>). Thomas’s response represents one of the strongest statements of Jesus’ deity in the New Testament and serves as the culmination of the Gospel of John’s portrayal of Jesus: “My Lord and my God!” (<a href="?bref=John.20.28">John 20:28</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later tradition speaks of Thomas working as a missionary in the East: in Parthia (Eusebius), Persia (Jerome), and India (<span class="ital">Acts of Thomas</span>). The Mar Thoma church on the west coast of India traces its roots back to the early missionary work of Thomas. The historical reliability of these accounts is uncertain.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Barnabas</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Barnabas is presented in Acts as a model Christian leader. A native of Cyprus, Barnabas was active in the Jerusalem church and demonstrated unselfish generosity in meeting the needs of the poorer members of that community (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.32-37">Acts 4:32-37</a>). His given name was Joseph, but he was nicknamed Barnabas (“Son of Encouragement,” <a href="?bref=Acts.4.36">4:36</a>), which indicates his character. He was a suitable person to give a fair and open-minded assessment of the new work in Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-22">11:19-22</a>). Barnabas perceived God’s blessing there and “encouraged the believers to stay true to the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.23">11:23</a>). His sterling character was clear in his transparent goodness, abundant faith, and Spirit-filled life and work (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.24">11:24</a>). The Holy Spirit chose Barnabas and Saul for a special work (known to us as the first missionary journey), and they were sent out by the church at Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Barnabas’s wisdom is evidenced in his earlier trip to Tarsus to find Saul (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.25">11:25</a>). Barnabas had been impressed by the boldness of Saul’s preaching as a new Christian in Damascus and had taken him to the apostles, providing a vital introduction for a man who was under suspicion for his previous unrelenting attacks against believers. Through Barnabas’s intervention, Saul obtained needed contact with the original apostles, received their acceptance, and preached fearlessly in Jerusalem until he was forced out of the city (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.26-30">9:26-30</a>). Barnabas’s trip was successful, and for a full year the two worked together in the Antioch church, drawing large crowds (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">11:26</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Barnabas was an impressive figure (note his reception in Lystra as Zeus, <a href="?bref=Acts.14.8-18">14:8-18</a>). He was John Mark’s cousin and mentor and played a major role in giving John Mark a second chance to make good as a Christian leader after he had abandoned an earlier mission (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.36-40">15:36-40</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Barnabas knew peer pressure, and he gave in to it on one occasion even though he knew better (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-13">Gal 2:11-13</a>). Barnabas wasn’t perfect, but he was a “Son of Encouragement,” to many and a generous, unselfish man who fostered growth in others and in the church.</p>

<p class="profile-title">Stephen</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Stephen was an exemplary early Christian who, as a result of the boldness of his witness, was arrested and killed by the Jewish authorities. He is known as the first Christian martyr.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Stephen was one of seven men chosen to help administer the distribution of food to needy Christians in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">Acts 6:1-6</a>). He was the most prominent of the seven and is singled out as a man “full of faith and the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">6:5</a>). Manifesting the grace and power of God in an unusual measure, he did miraculous things (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.8">6:8</a>) and proved to be a bold and effective evangelist and defender of the faith (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9-10">6:9-10</a>). His witness was so powerful, he was soon arrested by the authorities and brought before the high council for interrogation (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9-12">6:9-12</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When witnesses accused Stephen of speaking against the sacred Temple and the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.13-14">Acts 6:13-14</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Mark.13.2">Mark 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.19">John 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.21">4:21</a>), he defended himself before the Jewish high council (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-53">Acts 7:1-53</a>). He spoke of Israel’s long history of resisting God and his servants—first Moses and now the Prophet whom Moses had predicted (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.51-53">7:51-53</a>). The Jewish authorities, infuriated by Stephen’s bold accusations, dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.54-60">7:54-60</a>). As he died, Stephen prayed that they might be forgiven (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.60">7:60</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Stephen’s bold witness gave rise to the first wave of persecution of the early Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-3">8:1-3</a>). But this persecution resulted in the Good News spreading even wider as the believers fled Jerusalem and proclaimed the message of Jesus everywhere they went (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.4">8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-21">11:19-21</a>). Stephen’s martyrdom thus marks the beginning of the spread of the Good News beyond the borders of Judea.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Stephen’s life reminds us of the determined opposition that a faithful Christian witness can provoke. A bold testimony for Christ may be costly (see <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">Rev 2:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.2.13">13</a>), but there is no insuperable barrier to the growth of the church (see <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matt 16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-4">Acts 8:1-4</a>).</p>

Well respected among the early Christians, he was one of seven men chosen to administer the food-distribution program for needy believers in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">Acts 6:1-6</a>). Philip was a strong and effective evangelist in the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Christians were forced to flee Jerusalem following the death of Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-5">8:1-5</a>), Philip carried the Good News of Christ north to the ethnically mixed city of Samaria. There he performed many miraculous healings and exorcisms, and people responded eagerly to his message (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.5-8">8:5-8</a>). Many men and women were baptized, including a notorious sorcerer named Simon (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.9-13">8:9-13</a>). Then, directed by an angel, Philip traveled southwest from Jerusalem toward Gaza (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.26">8:26</a>). There, directed by the Spirit, he met the treasurer of Ethiopia, who was returning home after visiting Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.27-28">8:27-28</a>). When the Ethiopian asked Philip to help him understand <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>, Philip told him the Good News about Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.30-35">Acts 8:30-35</a>), then baptized the man by the roadside (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.36-38">8:36-38</a>). Philip was then suddenly taken away by the Spirit of God to the town of Azotus (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.39-40">8:39-40</a>), where he again preached the Good News.

We know about him from Luke’s account of his conversion and ministry in Acts and from the thirteen letters bearing his name in the New Testament.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul was born in Tarsus to Jewish parents who were Roman citizens (which enabled him to also acquire Roman citizenship) and grew up in a traditional Jewish home. A tentmaker (or leatherworker) by trade, he was educated as a Pharisee by the well-known rabbi Gamaliel in Jerusalem. He became active in the violent persecution of Christians as a young man (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.3-5">Acts 22:3-5</a>). But through a life-changing, personal revelation of the resurrected Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.3-6">9:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-10">22:6-10</a>), he was radically converted. He then dedicated the rest of his life to proclaiming Jesus as Savior and Lord throughout the Mediterranean world (see <a href="?bref=Gal.1.11-16">Gal 1:11-16</a>). His dedication and hard work, especially among Gentiles (to whom he was specifically called), resulted in the founding of scores of churches during the first century. Most of his letters were written to these churches.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul’s belief in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah set him apart from his Jewish contemporaries. His vision of Jesus brought him to the realization that Jesus’ death and resurrection bring righteousness and life-transforming power to those who believe in him. Paul no longer understood righteousness in terms of the careful observance of the law of Moses, but as a gift from God to those who put their trust in Christ, the Savior who died for their sins (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.1-8">Rom 4:1-8</a>). And he was convinced that this gift is for Gentiles as well as Jews.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul’s thirteen letters deal with a wide range of issues, such as salvation and what Christians believe about Christ (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians), specific problems in the church (1 Corinthians), the nature of Christian life and community (Ephesians, Colossians), and questions about Paul’s own authority as an apostle (2 Corinthians, Galatians). Some of his letters are intended to encourage young believers who are suffering for their faith (Philippians, 1 Thessalonians) or to correct false teachings (Galatians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians). Still others are written to individuals, giving specific advice related to their life and ministry (1–2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon). Together, these thirteen letters reveal much about the life of the earliest Christians and the problems they faced, and about Paul’s own grace-centered understanding of the Christian faith and life.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul’s letters, with their strong focus on Christ, reflect his all-consuming passion for Christ and his twin convictions that (1) salvation is given only to those who put their faith in Christ as Savior (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.16">Gal 2:16</a>), and (2) every part of a believer’s life is to be devoted to serving Christ as Lord (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.7-9">Rom 14:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.15">2 Cor 5:15</a>). Of all the New Testament writers, it is Paul who spells out most clearly what salvation is (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-8.39">Rom 1–8</a>) and gives us the fullest picture of the Christian life and Christian community. Paul’s letters also highlight the power of the Holy Spirit in believers’ lives (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9-13">Rom 8:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16-25">Gal 5:16-25</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Col 1:27</a>). He encourages believers to pursue the high standard of a life that is truly like Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.30">Rom 8:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.13">Eph 4:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Eph.4.15">15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>). Believers are to live a life of love (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">1 Cor 13:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.2">Eph 5:2</a>) and fully submit to Christ. Paul, more than any other New Testament writer, shows us how and why Christians must always find their deepest roots and motivation in the grace of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-2">Rom 12:1-2</a>). For Paul, the whole of a believer’s life—and indeed, the entire universe—is centered in Christ and Christ alone; everything finds its true meaning only in relation to him (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Col 1:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.6-3.4">2:6–3:4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Luke’s account of Paul’s missionary life, which spans a period of perhaps thirty years, begins with Paul’s preaching in Damascus shortly after his conversion (around <span class="era">AD</span> 32–35) and ends with his imprisonment in Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 60–62). But the Pastoral Letters (1 Timothy—Titus) appear to be dated to a later time, and reliable later traditions affirm that Paul was released from prison (around <span class="era">AD</span> 62) and continued his missionary activity. He was later rearrested, and after a lifetime of suffering as an evangelist for Christ, he was finally killed in Nero’s persecution of Christians around <span class="era">AD</span> 64–67. Paul’s desire, not only to suffer as Christ suffered but also to die as Christ died, was thus fulfilled—with the sure hope of one day being resurrected, just as Christ was resurrected (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.10-11">Phil 3:10-11</a>).</p>

<p class="profile-title">Herod Agrippa I</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Herod Agrippa I was Herod the Great’s grandson, Herod Antipas’s nephew, and Herodias’s brother. Agrippa I ruled the whole of Palestine for a short time following the death of Jesus, during the very early days of the Christian movement (<span class="era">AD</span> 41–44).</p>
<p class="profile-body">While at school in Rome, Agrippa lived a wanton life, incurring many debts. At one point he stated that he wished his friend Gaius Caligula were emperor rather than Tiberius. This was reported to Tiberius, who imprisoned him. He remained in prison until Tiberius’s death six months later.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Upon Caligula’s accession to the throne, he rewarded Agrippa by releasing him and giving him Philip the Tetrarch’s territories and the northern part of Lysanias’s territory as well as the title of king. This title aroused the jealousy of Herodias, and Herod Antipas (her husband) was both critical and jealous of Agrippa. Agrippa responded by accusing Antipas of conspiracy and orchestrating Antipas’s banishment. Agrippa then acquired all of Antipas’s territories and property (<span class="era">AD</span> 39).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When his friend Caligula died in <span class="era">AD</span> 41, Agrippa curried the favor of the new emperor, Claudius, whereupon Claudius added Judea and Samaria to Agrippa’s domain—territory once ruled by his grandfather, Herod the Great.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Agrippa was an active persecutor of the early Christians. He is remembered for killing the apostle James and having Peter arrested—acts which gained him the favor of the Jews (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-4">Acts 12:1-4</a>). The Jews, for their part, liked him more than any of the other Herods. Agrippa died suddenly in <span class="era">AD</span> 44 shortly after his subjects hailed him as a god (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.20-23">Acts 12:20-23</a>; see also Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 19.8.2; 19.9.1; <span class="ital">War</span> 2.11.5).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">John Mark</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">John Mark, writer of the earliest Gospel (the Gospel of Mark), was an assistant of three early missionaries—Barnabas, Paul, and Peter.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Mark was taken along as an assistant by Barnabas and Paul on their first missionary journey. However, for unknown reasons, he left them to return to Jerusalem before the trip was completed (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">Acts 12:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.4-5">13:4-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). Because of this, when Barnabas wanted to take him along on the second trip, Paul flatly refused. The sharp disagreement that resulted broke the team apart: Barnabas took Mark (his cousin) with him, while Paul chose Silas, and the two pairs went their separate ways (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.36-41">15:36-41</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, it appears that Paul and Mark were reconciled and that Mark once again served as his assistant. In Colossians, Paul refers to him as a coworker and suggests that he may soon be sending him to visit the church in Colosse (<a href="?bref=Col.4.10">Col 4:10</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>). Still later, when Paul was awaiting execution in prison in Rome, he asked Timothy to bring Mark with him, for he thought Mark would be helpful to him in his ministry (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">2 Tim 4:11</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Mark also appears to have assisted Peter when Peter was engaged in missionary work in Italy near the end of his life. In one of Peter’s letters, he speaks endearingly of Mark as his “son” who is with him (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Pet 5:13</a>). Early Christian tradition speaks of Mark as Peter’s “interpreter” and indicates that it was from Peter himself that Mark got the information for his account of the life and words of Jesus (Eusebius, <span class="ital">Church History</span> 3.39.16). Generally considered to be the earliest of all the Gospels, Mark’s Gospel was almost certainly one of the key sources used by Matthew and Luke when they later wrote their own Gospels. For this reason, Mark’s Gospel is one of the most influential of all the early Christian writings.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Mark’s story reminds us that God can overcome human failings and restore rocky relationships for the sake of Christ and the Good News. Early failures do not disqualify a person from a life of effective service and even lasting significance.</p>

<title>James, Brother of Jesus</title>
<refs>Acts.15.13-21</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">James, Brother of Jesus</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">James, one of Jesus’ brothers (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Matt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.19">Gal 1:19</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=Jude.1.1">Jude 1:1</a>), became the recognized leader of the church in Jerusalem shortly after Jesus’ resurrection. He is traditionally recognized as the author of the book of James.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though Jesus’ brothers were initially skeptical of his claims (<a href="?bref=John.7.2-5">John 7:2-5</a>), they later became believers (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.14">Acts 1:14</a>). James’s personal encounter with the resurrected Jesus (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.7">1 Cor 15:7</a>) might have helped convince him. Two of Jesus’ brothers (James and Jude) are known to have played significant roles in the early Christian community. James quickly rose to the position of leader of the church in Jerusalem. At the council in Jerusalem, James was instrumental in getting the Jewish church leaders to accept Gentile believers without requiring that they be circumcised—a decision of major importance for Paul and the early mission to Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.13-21">Acts 15:13-21</a>). Paul visited James in Jerusalem after his third missionary trip (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.18">Acts 21:18</a>), just as he had done earlier, following his conversion (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.19">Gal 1:19</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Like most Jewish Christians, James continued to observe the law of Moses. He emphasized the need for believers to observe certain key laws when among Jews (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.20-21">Acts 15:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.18-25">21:18-25</a>). James acknowledged the validity of Paul’s missionary calling and emphasis on salvation by faith alone (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.6-9">Gal 2:6-9</a>), but many Jewish Christians did not. These Jewish believers—whom Paul does link with James on one occasion (see Gal 2:12)—demanded that Gentile converts be circumcised and observe the law of Moses in order to join the Christian community.</p>
<p class="profile-body">James’s Jewish background is reflected in his letter, which is full of wise, practical advice for living, much of it in line with the traditional wisdom teaching of Jewish Scripture. One paragraph of his letter (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.1-6">Jas 5:1-6</a>) reads very much like the work of the Old Testament prophets (e.g., cp. <a href="?bref=Amos.5.21-24">Amos 5:21-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.1-7">6:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">James, titled “the Just” by his contemporaries, was apparently put to death for his faith by Jewish priests in Jerusalem (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.9; Eusebius, <span class="ital">Church History</span> 2.23.4–18).</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Luke</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Luke, a Gentile medical doctor who became a convert and trusted assistant of Paul in his missionary work, wrote both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles—roughly one-quarter of the New Testament.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Though we know very little about Luke’s background, he seems to have first encountered Paul and his preaching in western Asia Minor, where he became a convert. Leaving his home, he devoted his life to the service of Christ and the Good News as a dedicated assistant of Paul. Paul speaks of him warmly as “the beloved doctor” and one of his faithful “coworkers” (<a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Col 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>). Luke is the only Christian who faithfully remained with Paul when Paul was awaiting execution in Rome (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">2 Tim 4:11</a>). And he is the only Gentile to have his writings included in the New Testament.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Accompanying Paul on his last trip to Jerusalem, Luke probably acquired the information for his Gospel and the early part of the book of Acts from people he interviewed in Judea while Paul was imprisoned there for two years. Having talked extensively with people who heard and saw Jesus, and having carefully studied what others had written about him, Luke then wrote his own careful account of Jesus’ life and teachings (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-4">Luke 1:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Paul was sent by ship to Rome to have his case tried there, Luke accompanied him. While Paul was under house arrest, awaiting his trial, Luke might have used the time to write the book of Acts. The first fifteen chapters provide a chronological account of the earliest missionary work as told to him by the early followers of Christ—and probably by Paul himself. But beginning at <a href="?bref=Acts.16.10">Acts 16:10</a>—the point at which Luke joined Paul’s team—he provides a direct eyewitness account. In Acts, Luke emphasizes the way the Holy Spirit empowered and guided the early missionaries in their witness (see <a href="?bref=Acts.1.4-5">Acts 1:4-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">8</a>). The book ends with Paul still under house arrest in Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.30-31">28:30-31</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">We are indebted to Luke for many unique passages including his account of Jesus’ birth, descriptions of Jesus’ ministry to women, many words about Jesus caring for the poor, and the only comprehensive account of the first thirty years of Christian missionary activity—all carefully documented. Through Luke’s writings we gain a much deeper appreciation of the crucial work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry of Jesus and the early missionaries.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Priscilla and Aquila</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Priscilla and Aquila were a Christian couple with whom Paul lived and worked during his early days in Corinth. They were later active in Christian ministry and instrumental in bringing Apollos to a true understanding of Christ. They made a habit of opening their home in hospitality to other Christians.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul first met Priscilla and Aquila in Corinth, where they had recently arrived as a result of Claudius Caesar’s deportation of all Jews from Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 49). Paul became acquainted with them and, because they were tentmakers (or possibly leatherworkers) like he was, Paul lived and worked with them during his first year and a half in Corinth (<span class="era">AD</span> 50–52; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-3">18:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Paul left Corinth, he took Priscilla and Aquila with him and left them in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18-19">18:18-19</a>) while he returned to Jerusalem and Antioch. Later, when Apollos came through Ephesus, enthusiastically preaching about Jesus in the synagogues, Priscilla and Aquila took him aside and explained to him more fully the truth of Christ. As a result of their training, Apollos went on to become a powerful evangelist and Christian apologist (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-28">18:24-28</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, Paul speaks of their home as a meeting place for Christians in Ephesus, and he sends their greeting with his own to the church in Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>; cp. <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19">2 Tim 4:19</a>). Still later, it seems they returned to Rome (presumably after the relaxation of Claudius’s edict), for they are the first of many to whom Paul sends his greetings when he writes to the church in Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.3-5">Rom 16:3-5</a>). Here, too, their home became a meeting place. It is clear that Paul felt a close bond of friendship with them and that he regarded their work for Christ highly—he speaks of them as “my coworkers in the ministry of Christ,” and he refers to a time when they even risked their lives for him.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Priscilla and Aquila are examples of early Christians who, in the course of their daily work, were bold in bearing witness to Christ and active in ministering to his people—in this case, as a married couple dedicated to the service of Christ. The fact that Priscilla’s name often occurs first (which was unusual for the time) might say something about the strong role she played in the couple’s witness and ministry.</p>

<title>Apollos</title>
<refs>Acts.18.24-19.1</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Apollos</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Apollos was a Hellenistic (Greek-speaking) Jew, well versed in Scripture, who became a strong evangelist and Christian apologist. A native of Alexandria in Egypt, where there was a large Jewish community, Apollos apparently came under the influence of John the Baptist’s followers. He then became a bold and enthusiastic preacher of Jesus in Jewish synagogues, though he knew nothing of Christian baptism.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos preach in Ephesus, they invited him to their home and explained the way of Christ to him more fully. With the encouragement of the believers in Ephesus, who recognized his God-given gifts and ministry, Apollos then traveled on to Achaia (i.e., Corinth). There he greatly helped the believers as an effective defender of the Good News in public debate with the Jews, boldly demonstrating that Jesus is the Messiah predicted in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-28">Acts 18:24-28</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">A dynamic communicator, Apollos was popular with some of the Christians in Corinth because of his intellectual style and his powerful speaking abilities. As a result of his powerful ministry, some in Corinth were more drawn to Apollos than to Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.11-12">1 Cor 1:11-12</a>). Paul’s defense of himself and his simple, unimpressive way of preaching the Good News may have been precipitated by comparisons that people were making between him and Apollos. Significantly, Paul nowhere criticized Apollos himself. He called Apollos a fellow servant and was grateful for the follow-up work he had done—Apollos watered the seed that Paul had planted, and God blessed the work of both (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.5-9">1 Cor 3:5-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.1">4:1</a>). Rather, Paul criticized the shallow perspectives and divisiveness of those drawn to Apollos for superficial reasons (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.10-12">1 Cor 1:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.3-4">3:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.6-7">4:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Perhaps Apollos’s reluctance to return to Corinth from Ephesus (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.12">1 Cor 16:12</a>) was due to concern over the divisions that resulted from his ministry. Yet Paul encouraged him to return there at some point. Several years later, when Apollos was ministering on the island of Crete, Paul encouraged Titus to make sure Apollos’s needs were met as he set off to an unknown destination for further missionary service (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.13">Titus 3:13</a>). Apollos, with his strong intellectual gifts and powerful speaking abilities, had a significantly different approach and style from that of Paul, yet both men proved effective and useful in the service of Christ.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Herod Agrippa II</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Herod Agrippa II, son of Herod Agrippa I, succeeded his father as king and ruled in Palestine <span class="era">AD</span> 50–100, eventually controlling approximately the same area as his great-grandfather, Herod the Great. Agrippa II was in control of the Temple treasury and could appoint the high priest. He was not popular among Jews on account of his incestuous relationship with his sister Bernice. The Romans consulted him on religious matters, which is probably why Festus invited him to hear the apostle Paul’s defense at Caesarea (<span class="era">AD</span> 59, <a href="?bref=Acts.25.13-26.32">25:13–26:32</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In May <span class="era">AD</span> 66, the Jewish war against the Romans began (Josephus, <span class="ital">War</span> 2.14.4). When Agrippa’s attempt to quell the revolt failed, he became a staunch ally of the Romans throughout the entire war (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70). During this time Nero committed suicide, the new emperor Galba was murdered, and Vespasian became the emperor. After pledging his allegiance to the new emperor, Agrippa associated himself with Titus, Vespasian’s son, who was the general in charge of the war (Tacitus, <span class="ital">History</span> 5.81). After the fall of Jerusalem (Aug 6, <span class="era">AD</span> 70), Agrippa was probably present to celebrate the destruction of his own people.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In <span class="era">AD</span> 79 Vespasian died and Titus became emperor. Little is known of Agrippa’s rule after this, except that he wrote to the historian Josephus, praising him for <span class="ital">The Jewish War,</span> and he purchased a copy of it (Josephus, <span class="ital">Life</span> 65; <span class="ital">Against Apion</span> 1.9.47–52).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Although the Talmud implies that Agrippa II had two wives (Babylonian Talmud, <span class="ital">Sukkah</span> 27a), Josephus gives no indication that he had any wives or children. He died around <span class="era">AD</span> 100, and his death marks the end of the dynasty of the Herods.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Rome</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">In the first century <span class="era">AD</span> Rome was both a cosmopolitan city and a mighty empire that had brought peace and stability to the Mediterranean world.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Founding and Early Growth of Rome</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Rome was founded, according to tradition, in 753 <span class="era">BC</span> on the Tiber River in Italy by a Latin-speaking agricultural tribe. A loose association of chieftains comprised the earliest Senate.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Around 600 <span class="era">BC</span> the Etruscans from central Italy invaded the territory of Rome and became its rulers. They constructed numerous works, including the forum, which became the social, commercial, and political center for the city, and a temple for Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Rome was now linked by roads to the Etruscans in the north, to the Greek trading cities in the south, to the sea to the west, and to the inland highlands to the east.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Roman Republic</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">When Rome’s kings became autocratic, the Latin population rebelled. In 509 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome established a “republic,” an oligarchy of the powerful families who controlled the Senate. The small city-state steadily gained control of the region, expanding their influence across the Mediterranean. In 273 <span class="era">BC</span> they made a treaty with the Ptolemies of Egypt. They expanded into North Africa, defeating the rival city-state Carthage in the course of the three Punic Wars (264–146 <span class="era">BC</span>), and pressed on into Spain. Rome’s many conquests brought enormous wealth.</p>
<p class="profile-body">With geographical expansion came social changes in Italy. Between 200 and 100 <span class="era">BC</span>, rich landowners bought out small independent farmers, who subsequently drifted into Rome, landless and unemployed. Huge, overcrowded slums appeared alongside the vast wealth and magnificent buildings. The foundations of the republic were cracking under the strain of popular discontent.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Beginning of the Empire: Julius and Octavian</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">During this time of social and political upheaval, Julius Caesar pursued an ambitious and tumultuous career which sought to centralize power in his own person. Senators who favored the old republic assassinated him in 44 <span class="era">BC</span>, but their action ultimately backfired: Julius’s grandnephew and heir, Octavian, became a senator, consul, and the commander-in-chief in 43 <span class="era">BC</span> with the support of the Senate. The Senate also deified Julius in 42 <span class="era">BC</span>. After Octavian defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra in 31 <span class="era">BC</span> and took control of Egypt, the Senate gave him the titles Augustus (“illustrious”) and Princeps (“first citizen”) in 27 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Octavian began to call himself “son of a god” because of Julius’s divine status. The form of a republic survived, but the reality of a divine emperor had arrived.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">Jesus and the Birth of the Church</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">“When the right time came, God sent his Son” (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.4">Gal 4:4</a>). The change into an empire brought peace and stability, a <span class="ital">pax Romana</span> (“Roman peace”) that lasted well into the 100s <span class="era">AD</span>. Many observers have noted that Roman rule during the first century <span class="era">AD</span> provided the ideal setting for the spread of Christianity. The borders were secure and the roads were good, making travel relatively trouble-free. Roman laws and customs protected the rights of its citizens (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.16.35-40">Acts 16:35-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.24-29">22:24-29</a>). Judaism was protected, and the Romans viewed Christianity as a sect within Judaism (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.25.13-19">Acts 25:13-19</a>). As a result, the Romans largely rejected complaints against Christians on religious grounds (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-41">Acts 19:23-41</a>). Christians were free to proclaim the Good News about Jesus, and many people of all nationalities became followers of Christ.</p>
<p class="profile-h1">The Changing Status of Christianity</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">This favorable situation began to change in the time of Nero. Nero blamed Christians for the fire that destroyed a good part of Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 64, and he proceeded with the first large-scale persecution of Christians. The overt persecution ceased in <span class="era">AD</span> 66, but Christianity was no longer viewed as a sect of Judaism and lost its protected status. It later became imperial policy to require people to burn incense to the emperor—those who refused were usually either Jews (who were protected) or Christians (who were not). As a result, from the time of Domitian (<span class="era">AD</span> 81–96) to Galerius (<span class="era">AD</span> 305–311), Christianity was officially illegal, punishable by death, and persecuted to varying extents depending on the zeal of those in power. Thus for over two hundred years Rome drank “the blood of God’s holy people who were witnesses for Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.6">Rev 17:6</a>).</p>

<title>Nero</title>
<refs>Rom.13.1-7</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Nero</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Nero became emperor of Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 54 at the age of 17 after his mother poisoned her husband, the emperor Claudius. Nero enjoyed performing in the limelight and was a sexually depraved and profligate man. Yet the early years of Nero’s reign were stable and competently administered by his advisers, the prefect Burrus and the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nero’s debauched character would have been well known when Paul wrote to the Romans around <span class="era">AD</span> 57 to “submit to governing authorities” as having been “placed there by God” (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.1">Rom 13:1</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Nero’s worst actions came after he arranged his mother’s murder in <span class="era">AD</span> 59 (the same year in which Paul appealed to Caesar, <a href="?bref=Acts.25.11">Acts 25:11</a>). In <span class="era">AD</span> 62 he banished and then executed his wife, married his lover, and forced Burrus and Seneca into retirement. In <span class="era">AD</span> 64 a fire devastated a large area of Rome. At the time, Nero was away from the city, but many people believed the rumor that Nero had set the fire himself. Nero found a scapegoat in Christians, whom he charged with the crime. Christians were widely seen as hostile to civil society and thus deserving of punishment, even if few believed that they had started the fire; they were “convicted not so much of arson as of hatred of the human race” (Tacitus, <span class="ital">Annals</span> 15.44). The ensuing persecution of Christians in Rome was intense; it is likely that Peter and Paul were executed in Rome at this time.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In <span class="era">AD</span> 66 a Jewish revolt broke out in Caesarea. Nero dispatched his general Vespasian to squelch the revolt, taking no interest in the affairs of state. He spent the next two years doing performances in Greece, leaving the responsibility of governing to a Roman prefect. Because of the opposition he encountered from leading governors in France, Spain, and Africa on his return to Rome, Nero committed suicide in <span class="era">AD</span> 68, exclaiming at his death, “What an artist dies with me!” He was the last and worst emperor of the line of Julius Caesar.

<title>The Roman Church</title>
<refs>Rom.16.1-16</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">The Roman Church</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">The details of the founding of the church in Rome are not known with certainty. There was a large Jewish population in Rome, and some Jews from Rome were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost at the birth of the church (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>). The most likely explanation, then, is that some of these Jews converted to Christianity and took the Good News about Jesus the Messiah to Rome, where a Christian community was born from within the synagogues of Rome. It is unlikely that Peter founded the Roman church or that he was present in Rome by the time Paul wrote to the Roman Christians around <span class="era">AD</span> 57; otherwise, Paul would certainly have greeted him. Consequently, Paul wrote this letter to help ensure that the Roman church had apostolic involvement in their faith. He never wrote to the churches of Judea, founded by the other apostles, but only to churches that either he had founded (e.g., Corinth, Galatia) or to those that had no direct apostolic involvement (e.g., Colosse, Rome).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In time, the Jewish Christians in Rome would have been pushed out of the synagogues by the non-Christian Jews, as happened elsewhere. By the time Paul wrote to the Roman church, they were meeting as separate house churches in private homes (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.5">Rom 16:5</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.16.10-11">10-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.16.15">15</a>). There were no centralized edifices, and it is uncertain whether the whole body of believers in Rome met together.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome (around <span class="era">AD</span> 49), the Jewish Christians were also forced to leave, among whom were Priscilla and Aquila (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). In the absence of the Jews, the Roman church would have become Gentile in character. When the Jews returned (probably shortly after the death of Claudius in <span class="era">AD</span> 54), there were no doubt questions—if not conflicts—among the Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul may have written Romans to settle such controversies among this mixed group of Jews and Gentiles worshiping Christ in the same city.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As is evident from <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">Romans 16</a>, Paul already had many friends in the Roman church. In the spring of <span class="era">AD</span> 60, roughly two years after writing Romans, Paul had the opportunity to go to Rome—a desire he had repeatedly expressed (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.21">Acts 19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.13-15">Rom 1:13-15</a>). He spent two years there under house arrest awaiting his first trial before Nero, “boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.30-31">Acts 28:30-31</a>).</p>

<title>Corinth</title>
<refs>1Cor.1.1-16.24</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Corinth</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Corinth was one of the oldest cities of Greece, with evidence of settlement going back to at least 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Its prime location along both east-west and north-south trade routes enabled it to become a center of commerce and trade, and it reached the height of its strength and power between 800 and 600 <span class="era">BC</span>. When in the mid-100s <span class="era">BC</span> the Roman military machine began a relentless march to forge a vast empire, Corinth led the Hellenic League to oppose Roman dominance in Greece. They were no match for the Romans, and in 146 <span class="era">BC</span> Corinth was completely destroyed, its men executed, its women and children sold into slavery. Corinth lay in ruins for a century.</p>
<p class="profile-body">In 44 <span class="era">BC</span> Julius Caesar established a Roman colony at Corinth. The colony attracted a mixed group of Italians, freedmen (freed former slaves) from Rome, and dispossessed Greeks. With great industry and ingenuity the new inhabitants quickly reestablished the city as a prosperous center for trade, commerce, and industry. By the time Paul came to Corinth, it was a bustling cosmopolitan city with a population of almost 700,000, including many wealthy people, and many others who were struggling to become so. Corinth attracted tradespeople from all over the world, though its reputation also grew as a center of luxury, indulgence, and vice. Corinth had a reputation for promiscuity and prostitution, so much so that the verb “Corinthianize” meant having immoral sex. The church in Corinth struggled with sexual immorality (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-13">1 Cor 5:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-20">6:12-20</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Corinth was also prominent because of the Isthmian Games, which dated from 523 <span class="era">BC</span> and occurred every two years. Competition centered on three kinds of events: equestrian, gymnastic, and musical. By the New Testament period, the games included chariot racing and other Roman spectacles in addition to the traditional Greek competitions. In an allusion to these athletic contests, Paul mentioned both running and boxing (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.24-26">1 Cor 9:24-26</a>). The winners of the games were national heroes. The prize for winning the games was a wreath made of myrtle, olive, or pine branches, plus the additional benefits of a stipend from the state, remission of taxes, and special benefits for the champion’s children.</p>
<p class="profile-body">As in most Roman cities, marble temples dominated the landscape; participation in the worship of the gods and their feasts was a prominent part of life in Corinth. These pagan feasts were another major issue that the Corinthian church wrestled with (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-10.33">8:1–10:33</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">A large colony of displaced Jews also developed in the city, many of whom may have arrived after the emperor Claudius’s edict expelling Jews from Rome (see <a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). When Paul traveled to Corinth on his second missionary journey, he met Aquila and Priscilla, who became his close friends and co-workers (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-3">Acts 18:1-3</a>). Paul stayed at Corinth for over a “year and a half, teaching the word of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.11">Acts 18:11</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The church of Corinth, born in such a hothouse of paganism and promiscuity, went through serious birth pangs. Their troubles provide, through Paul’s letters to them, a rich collection of solutions to the practical issues of Christian life and community.</p>

<title>Ephesus</title>
<refs>Eph.1.1-6.24</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Ephesus</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Ephesus stood at the crossroads of both north-south and east-west trade routes and was well known as the “guardian” of the temple of Artemis (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.35">Acts 19:35</a>). It was founded by Ionian Greeks around 1044 <span class="era">BC</span> on a natural harbor where the Cayster River emptied into a gulf of the Aegean Sea (the site of the ancient city is now well inland). The city came under Roman rule in 41 <span class="era">BC</span>. At the time of the apostles, Ephesus was a wealthy city, a commercial and religious hub, and thus the most important city of the Roman province of Asia.</p>
<p class="profile-body">The worship of Artemis in Ephesus was nearly as ancient as the city itself. The temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a key to the wealth and commerce of Ephesus, because the worship of Artemis brought many pilgrims to Ephesus and provided many commercial opportunities for idol makers and other vendors of goods and services.</p>
<p class="profile-body">When Paul arrived on his third missionary journey in <span class="era">AD</span> 53 (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-41">Acts 19</a>), Ephesus had been a city continuously for over a thousand years and was deeply devoted to its patron goddess and her temple. As Paul’s message began to gain more adherents, Christianity threatened the pagan temple and the commerce it produced for the makers of idols. The ensuing riot almost cost the apostle Paul his life (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.24">Acts 19:24</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.19.28-31">28-31</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The church of Ephesus became strong under Paul’s teaching and leadership, and churches in the surrounding communities were founded by people who had learned from Paul in Ephesus (e.g., Colosse; see <a href="?item=Col_BookIntro_Filament">Colossians Book Introduction</a>, “Setting”). But Paul warned the leaders of the Ephesian church that they would be troubled by false teachers (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.29-31">Acts 20:29-31</a>).</p> 
<p class="profile-body">The apostle John is thought to have settled in Ephesus around <span class="era">AD</span> 70; from there he was exiled to the island of Patmos (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rev 1:9</a>), where he wrote Revelation (probably in the <span class="era">AD</span> 90s). At that time, the commendable love and good works of the Christian community described in the letter to the Ephesians had been largely abandoned (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.4">Rev 2:4</a>). Irenaeus records that, after John’s exile on Patmos, the apostle returned to live in Ephesus and lived there until the end of his life during the time of the emperor Trajan (<span class="era">AD</span> 98–117). According to tradition, Mary the mother of Jesus also finished her days on earth in Ephesus under John’s care (see <a href="?bref=John.19.25-27">John 19:25-27</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The temple of Artemis was burned by the Goths in <span class="era">AD</span> 262, and Artemis was no longer influential among the Ephesians when the third ecumenical council was held in Ephesus in <span class="era">AD</span> 431, thus illustrating the truth of Paul’s message that “handmade gods” like Artemis “aren’t really gods at all” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.26">Acts 19:26</a>).</p>

<title>Philippi</title>
<refs>Phil.1.1-4.23</refs>
<body>
<p class="profile-title">Philippi</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Philippi was a minor village of Thrace until about 357 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, conquered the site and rebuilt it. He named the village after himself, fortified it as a military stronghold, and exploited the nearby gold mines. Philippi gained worldwide fame in 42 <span class="era">BC</span> as the site where the imperial armies of Octavian and Mark Antony defeated the republican generals Brutus and Cassius, the assassins of Julius Caesar. The victory opened the way for the emergence of the Roman Empire under the rule of Octavian Augustus.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Many veterans from the war of 42 <span class="era">BC</span> and other battles settled in Philippi. When Paul came to the city, it still reflected its Roman military heritage. Situated on the Egnatian Way, it was a prominent stop on that great military highway connecting the Adriatic Sea with the Aegean Sea. It possessed distinct civic pride as a Roman colony (enjoying numerous privileges, such as tax exemption) and promoted Latin as its official language. Its government was modeled on the municipal constitution of Rome, and the inhabitants viewed themselves as Romans (see <a href="?bref=Acts.16.21">Acts 16:21</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Paul visited the city on his second missionary journey, and the account of Acts gives detailed attention to this visit (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.12-40">Acts 16:12-40</a>). The narrative frequently refers to the city’s Roman heritage: Not only does Paul successfully employ his Roman citizenship in his defense (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37-39">Acts 16:37-39</a>), but the city magistrates bear the dignified Latin title <span class="ital">praetor</span> (given in its Greek translation, <span class="greek">stratēgos</span>—<a href="?bref=Acts.16.20-22">Acts 16:20-22</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.16.38">38</a>). There also appears to have been a small Jewish community there. The church began with believing Jewish women who met outside the city because there was no synagogue. Later, they convened in the home of an important woman convert named Lydia (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14-15">Acts 16:14-15</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.16.40">40</a>). Luke apparently stayed in Philippi when Paul departed for Thessalonica (cp. <a href="?bref=Acts.16.12">Acts 16:12</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.16.40">40</a>) and later rejoined Paul at Philippi when Paul passed through on his third missionary journey several years later (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.6">Acts 20:6</a>).

<p class="profile-title">Timothy</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Timothy traveled with Paul for much of his missionary career and was one of Paul’s best-loved and most trusted assistants. Two of Paul’s last letters were written to Timothy at a time when Timothy was providing leadership for the church in Ephesus, near the end of Paul’s life.</p>
<p class="profile-body">Timothy had a devout mother and grandmother (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.5">2 Tim 1:5</a>), and he was highly respected by the Christians in his hometown, Lystra, and in nearby Iconium. He joined Paul’s missionary team on Paul’s second missionary journey. Paul speaks of prophetic words that confirmed Timothy’s selection. Timothy also received a special gifting for service through the laying on of the hands of the elders and of Paul (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.18">1 Tim 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6">2 Tim 1:6</a>). Out of deference to the Jews in the area, Paul had Timothy circumcised (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-3">Acts 16:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Over the next fifteen years, Paul sent Timothy on special assignments to several different churches (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.22">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.17">1 Cor 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.10-11">16:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.19-23">Phil 2:19-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.1-6">1 Thes 3:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.3">1 Tim 1:3</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.17.14-15">Acts 17:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.5">18:5</a>). Paul included Timothy’s name as coauthor of several of his letters (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1">2 Cor 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Phil 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.1">Col 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1 Thes 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.1">2 Thes 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1">Phlm 1:1</a>). It is clear that Paul had a close relationship with Timothy and held him in high regard (see <a href="?bref=Rom.16.21">Rom 16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.17">1 Cor 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.2">1 Thes 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.2">1 Tim 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.11">6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.2">2 Tim 1:2</a>). As Paul neared the end of his life and awaited his sentence in prison, he longed to see Timothy (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.3-4">2 Tim 1:3-4</a>). Of all Paul’s coworkers, Timothy especially is commended for his selfless concern for Christ and his people (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.20-22">Phil 2:20-22</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">In Paul’s second letter to Timothy (2 Timothy), written shortly before Paul was killed, he encouraged Timothy to be bold and fearless in his proclamation of the Good News, willing to suffer for Christ (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">2 Tim 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.1-3">2:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1-2">4:1-2</a>, <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.5">5</a>)—a strong word to one who might have been timid by nature (see <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6-7">2 Tim 1:6-7</a>). Timothy himself seems to have become a prisoner later on (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.23">Heb 13:23</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Timothy was exemplary in the way he faithfully served the cause of Christ behind the scenes, devoting himself selflessly and with single-minded focus to the work of Christ and the people of Christ wherever help was needed. He serves as a reminder that believers should seek to become strong and effective witnesses for Christ.</p>

<body>
<p class="profile-title">Titus</p>
<p class="profile-body-fl">Titus was a Gentile convert who served as one of Paul’s trusted assistants. One of Paul’s last letters was addressed to him, when Titus was helping to consolidate the church at Crete. Titus is an example of the Gentile converts who were so deeply touched by the Good News of Christ that they left their homes and devoted their lives to assisting Paul in the proclamation of the Good News.</p>
<p class="profile-body">We know nothing about Titus’s background or conversion; his name is not mentioned in Acts. We first hear of him as a Gentile believer who accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">Gal 2:1</a>). Significantly, Paul emphasized that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.3">Gal 2:3</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">Later, as a trusted member of Paul’s team, Titus was sent on special assignments. He was the one sent by Paul to Corinth to deal with a difficult situation there (apparently carrying the demanding letter mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.4">2 Cor 2:4</a>, <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.9">9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.8-9">7:8-9</a>). This task required both tact and strong leadership (Titus’s personality seems to have been stronger than Timothy’s; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.10-11">1 Cor 16:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.13-15">2 Cor 7:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6-7">2 Tim 1:6-7</a>). When Titus returned to Paul with good news (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.6-7">2 Cor 7:6-7</a>, <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.13-15">13-15</a>), Paul sent him back to Corinth carrying the letter we call 2 Corinthians to encourage the believers to complete their money-raising project for the poor believers in Jerusalem. It was an assignment he eagerly accepted because of his love for the Christians in Corinth (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.15">2 Cor 7:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.6">8:6</a>, <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.16-17">16-17</a>). Paul speaks of him as a person of integrity and as one who is similar to Paul himself (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.23">2 Cor 8:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.18">12:18</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">A few years later, following Paul’s first trial in Rome and subsequent release, Paul left Titus on the island of Crete to help consolidate the church. While Titus was there, Paul wrote his letter to Titus, giving him advice on choosing church leaders and encouraging him to teach and model godly behavior. Paul then asked Titus to meet him at Nicopolis (in Achaia), where Paul hoped to spend the winter (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">Titus 3:12</a>). Later, shortly before Paul was killed in Rome, he wrote that Titus had gone to Dalmatia (along the Adriatic coast, northwest of modern-day Greece), probably for ministry there (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Tim 4:10</a>).</p>
<p class="profile-body">The church historian Eusebius refers to an early tradition that Titus eventually settled on Crete, serving as the bishop there until he was quite old (Eusebius, <span class="ital">Church History</span> 3.4.6).</p>
